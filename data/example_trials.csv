The planned number of participants for this study is approximately 1200 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either gantenerumab or placebo (600 participants randomized to gantenerumab and 600 participants randomized to placebo).",YES,Alzheimers Disease,DRUG: Gantenerumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in PACC-5 Score, The PACC-5 is computed as the average of z-scores of the following cognitive measures: 1. Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS LM I-II) - Total Score LM II Delayed Recall; 2. Free \& Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) -Immediate and Delayed Recall - Trials 1-3: Total Recall; 3. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - IV Coding - Total Raw Score; 4. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) - Total Score; 5. Category Fluency Test (CFT) - 3 categories - Vegetables, Fruits and Animals - Total Admissible Words. The z-score was defined as the difference between the assessment and the mean of baseline assessments, divided by the standard deviation of baseline assessments. Z-scores range from -3 to +3 with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)","Time From Randomization to Clinical Progression to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Dementia Due to AD, Time from randomization to clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease was based on the diagnosis of the independent Clinical Adjudication Committee (iCAC)., Randomization to early termination Visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Time to Onset of Confirmed Clinical Progression, Time to onset of confirmed clinical progression was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of two consecutive visits (approximately 6 months apart) with a Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR-GS) of \> 0. CDR is a clinician reported (ClinRO) measure used to stage severity of AD dementia based on a semi-structured interview with participant \& a reliable informant. CDR characterizes participant's level of cognitive \& functional impairment across six domains (memory, orientation, judgment \& problem solving, community affairs, home \& hobbies, \& personal care) on a 5-point rating. CDR-GS is calculated based on the Washington University CDR-assignment algorithm \& characterizes a participant's level of global impairment/stage of dementia according to following categories: 0 (normal), 0.5 (very mild dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), \& 3 (severe dementia). Score ranges from 0 to 3 \& a high score on CDR-GS would indicate a high disease severity., Randomization to early termination Visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire Short Version (A-IADL-Q-SV), A-IADL-Q-SV=observer reported (ObsRO) measure assessing participant's ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (including household/leisure activities, use of household appliances, management of finances, etc.). A-IADL-Q-SV includes 30 items rated by study partner. Each item is divided into 2 questions=1st question asks if activity was performed by participant during past 4 weeks (Yes/No/Don't know). If performed, 2nd question captures level of difficulty while performing activity on 5-point Likert scale (no difficulty to no longer able to perform the activity). If not performed, 2nd question captures why activity was not performed (never done before, no longer able to do so due to physical problems, no longer able to do so due to difficulties with memory/planning/thinking/other, including free text response). A-IADL-Q-SV=average of all scored responses multiplied by 25. Score range=0-100. Higher scores=better functioning. Negative change from baseline=worsening., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the Cognitive Function Instrument Acute (CFIa) Participant Version, The CFIa is an outcome measure developed to assess memory-related cognitive and functional decline in non-demented elderly individuals. The CFIa is a modified version of the original CFI and differs in terms of recall period and item response options. The CFIa is computed as the sum of 14 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Never=0 to Always=4 and referring to the participant's current ability (most recent experience). Total scores range from 0 to 56. Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement. The participant (PRO) and study partner (ObsRO) versions of the CFIa were used in this study., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the CFIa Study Partner Version, The CFIa is an outcome measure developed to assess memory-related cognitive and functional decline in non-demented elderly individuals.

The PRO and ObsRO versions of the CFIa were used in this study., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), The CDR is a ClinRO measure used to stage the severity of AD dementia based on a semi-structured interview with the participant and a reliable informant. The CDR characterizes the participant's level of cognitive and functional impairment across six domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care) on a 5-point rating scale in which 0 = None, 0.5 = questionable, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe (with the exception of personal care, which is rated on a 4-point rating scale and excludes the questionable impairment level). The CDR-SB is calculated by summing the ratings across each of the six domains (total score: 0 to 18), with higher scores indicating greater impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability or incapacity, and leads to congenital anomaly or birth defect. An AESI included drug induced liver injury and suspected transmission of infectious agent via medicinal products., Day 1 to safety follow-up visit (up to 310 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Gantenerumab, The number of ADA-positive participants after drug administration were determined for participants exposed to gantenerumab. For determining post-baseline incidence, participants were considered to be ADA-positive if they were ADA-negative or had missing data at baseline but developed an ADA response following study drug exposure, or if they were ADA-positive at baseline and the titer of 1 or more post-baseline samples was at least 4-fold higher in comparison to the titer at the baseline. As prespecified in the protocol, this outcome measure was applicable only to participants exposed to gantenerumab., Day 1 to early termination visit (up to 216 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Findings: Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities - Edema/Effusion (ARIA-E) and ARIA-Hemosiderin Deposition (ARIA-H), ARIA are an identified risk with anti-amyloid antibodies, including gantenerumab. These changes can be identified on brain MRI. In ARIA-E, (E for edema or effusion), edema can be seen in different areas of the brain on MRI, representing fluid leakage into the brain parenchyma or sulcal spaces. ARIA-H (H for hemosiderosis) are small foci of signal loss observed on MRI sequences sensitive for paramagnetic tissue properties and comprise cerebral microbleeds (small foci of bleeding in the brain parenchyma) and leptomeningeal hemosiderosis (small foci of bleeding on the surface of the brain). These changes also occur sporadically in AD., Day 1 to early termination visit (up to 248 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Injection-site Reactions (ISRs), An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. Local injection reactions (or injection-site reactions) are defined as AEs related to the injection site that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration that are judged to be related to the study drug injection., Day 1 to safety follow-up visit (up to 310 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Post-baseline Suicidal Behaviors and Ideations as Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score, The C-SSRS is an assessment tool used to assess the lifetime suicidality of a participant (baseline) as well as any new instances of suicidality (since last visit). The structured interview prompts recollection of suicidal ideation (SI), including the intensity of the ideation, behavior, \& attempts with actual or potential lethality. Categories have binary responses (yes/no) \& include: Wish to be Dead; Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts; Active SI with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act; Active SI with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan; Active SI with Specific Plan \& Intent, Preparatory Acts \& Behavior; Aborted Attempt; Interrupted Attempt; Actual Attempt (non-fatal); Completed Suicide. SI or behavior is indicated by a ""yes"" answer to any of the listed categories. A score of 0 is assigned if no suicide risk is present. A score of 1 or higher indicates SI or behavior. Only categories with at least one participant with event are reported., Day 1 to safety follow-up visit (up to 310 days from start of treatment)|Change in Brain Amyloid Load Over Time as Measured by Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in a Subset of Participants, Brain amyloid load over time was planned to be assessed using \[18F\] florbetaben or \[18F\] flutemetamol tracers. These are PET radioligand selective to amyloid. Amyloid PET burden is measured in a composite region of interest (ROI) by using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) mapped to the centiloid scale. The weighted composite target region are composed of (both left and right side): frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe lateral, cingulum posterior and anterior cingulate gyrus. The reference region used to normalize the composite region is the whole cerebellum. The centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan., Baseline|Change in Brain Tau Load Over Time as Measured by Tau PET in a Subset of Participants, Change in tau load represents how much neurofibrillary tau pathology is present in brain assessed using PET scan. For the longitudinal tau PET assessment, \[18F\]-MK-6240 was used. Tau load is measured using SUVR in four composite target ROIs: Temporal composite target region included (both left \& right) anterior \& posterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior temporal lobe, fusiform gyrus, \& middle and inferior temporal gyrus; Medial temporal composite region not including hippocampus included (both left \& right): amygdala, parahippocampus \& anterior medial \& lateral temporal lobe; Frontal lobe (both left \& right) \& Parietal lobe (both left \& right).

By its prevalence and its medical and social consequences, AD represents a dual challenge to public health and society. The elderly want to stay in their homes even when their lives are altered by a chronic progressive disease. Their caregivers claim in turn a support at home. But this desire is questioned because of the characteristics of the disease, e.g. the altered relational function by the cognitive impairment and the behavioural disorders associated.

Outpatients non-drug therapies represent a potential support that adapts to patient with an AD or mixed dementia, especially in their milder forms.

NCT00676143,Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Bapineuzumab in Alzheimer Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00676143,,TERMINATED,This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease. Patients will receive either bapineuzumab or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 1.5 years.,YES,Alzheimer Disease,DRUG: bapineuzumab|DRUG: placebo,"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)/11 Subscale Total Score at Week 78, The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension.

This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced.

The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment., Baseline and 78 weeks|Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Total Score at Week 78, The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant.

This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement., Baseline and 78 weeks","Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71, Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semi-quantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants., Baseline and 71 weeks|Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Phospho-tau Levels at Week 71, Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab., Baseline and 71 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume, as Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI), at Week 71, Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment., Baseline and 71 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the ADAS-Cog/11 Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, Treatment differences are estimated using least-squares (LS) means with factor levels weighted according to overall analysis population proportions. ADAS-Cog/11 total score range is 0 (least impairment) to 70 (most impairment); a negative treatment difference (bapineuzumab minus placebo) favors bapineuzumab. Within the MMRMs for ADAS-Cog/11 described for the primary analyses, linear contrasts were formed to test increasing trend of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo from Week 39 (the 9-month visit) through Week 78 (the 18 -month visit) for each variable, which is equivalent to testing a positive slope of the differences between each bapineuzumab dose group and placebo from Week 39 through Week 78. Results are from a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for MMRM., Week 39 to Week 78|Divergence of Effect on the DAD Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, Treatment differences are estimated using least-squares (LS) means with factor levels weighted according to overall analysis population proportions. DAD total score range is 0 to 100; a positive treatment difference (bapineuzumab minus placebo) favors bapineuzumab. Within the MMRMs for ADAS-Cog/11 described for the primary analyses, linear contrasts were formed to test increasing trend of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo from Week 39 (the 9-month visit) through Week 78 (the 18 -month visit) for each variable, which is equivalent to testing a positive slope of the differences between each bapineuzumab dose group and placebo from Week 39 through Week 78.

The DS total score ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating more need for assistance. The DS was administered as an interview to the caregiver at scheduled study visits., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (EU Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants with worsening from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score of ≤0, ≤3, and ≤7 points were reported. In order to calculate time to first median placebo deterioration in ADAS-Cog/11, the median change from baseline to Week 78 among the placebo participants of the mITT analysis population were determined. The median changes were used as the cutpoints for determining ""deterioration"" for Alzheimer's disease participants in the study. If the median change from baseline to Week 78 in the ADAS-Cog/11 total score among the placebo participants of the mITT Analysis Population is 7 points, then the first median placebo deterioration is the first time where there is a worsening on the ADAS-Cog/11 total score of 7 points or more and the worsening is confirmed by the ADAS-Cog/11 assessment at the next non-missing visit., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Responders for ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose increase (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score was \<7., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in DAD Total Score at Week 78 (EU Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score of ≤ 0, ≤ 6, and ≤ 12 points. In order to calculate time to first median placebo deterioration in DAD, the median change from baseline to Week 78 among the placebo participants of the mITT analysis population were determined. The median changes were used as the cutpoints for determining ""deterioration"" for Alzheimer's disease participants in the study. If the median change from baseline to Week 78 in the DAD total score among the placebo participants of the mITT Analysis Population is 7 points, then the first median placebo deterioration is the first time where there is a worsening on the DAD total score of 7 points or more and the worsening is confirmed by the DAD assessment at the next non-missing visit., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Responders for DAD Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score was \<12., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 78, The CDR-SOB is a global clinical staging instrument that sums 6 clinical ratings: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) interview. The CDR includes discussions with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant.

NCT00667810,Study Evaluating The Efficacy And Safety Of Bapineuzumab In Alzheimer Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00667810,,TERMINATED,This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease. Patients will receive either bapineuzumab or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 1.5 years.,YES,Alzheimer Disease,DRUG: bapineuzumab|DRUG: bapineuzumab|DRUG: placebo,"The Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)/11 Total Score at Week 78, The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment., 78 weeks|The Change From Baseline in the Disability Assessment for Demential (DAD) Total Score at Week 78, The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement., 78 weeks","The Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71., Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semiquantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants., 71 Weeks|The Change From Baseline in Phospho-tau Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) at Week 71., Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau (p-tau) is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab., 71 Weeks|The Change From Baseline in Brain Volume at Week 71, Brain volume was examined in a subset of participants by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI). Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment., 71 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the ADAS-Cog/11 Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, The MMRM estimated slope (based on linear contrasts) of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo for the ADAS-Cog/11 total scores from Week 39 to Week 78 was presented., 39 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the DAD Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, The MMRM estimated slope (based on linear contrasts)of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo for the DAD total scores from Week 39 to Week 78 was presented., 39 weeks|Time to Median Placebo Deterioration on ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score (European Union [EU] Analysis Plan), The time to first median placebo deterioration (for the EU) was defined as the first time a subject experienced an increase from baseline (worsening) in ADAS Cog/11 total score greater than or equal to the median worsening observed at Week 78 in the placebo group. The Kaplan Meier estimate of the median time to first median placebo deterioration in ADAS Cog/11 total score was presented., 78 Weeks|Time to First Clinically Meaningful Deterioration on ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score (United States [US] Analysis Plan), The time to first clinically meaningful deterioration (for the US) was defined as the first time a participant experienced an increase (worsening) from baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 total score of \>=7., 78 weeks|Time to Median Placebo Deterioration on DAD Total Score, The time to first median placebo deterioration (for the EU) was defined as the first time a participant experienced a decrease (worsening) in DAD total score greater than or equal to the median worsening at Week 78 in the placebo group., 78 Weeks|Time to First Clinically Meaningful Deterioration on DAD Total Score (US Analysis Plan), The time to first clinically meaningful deterioration was defined as the first time a participant experienced a decrease (worsening)from baseline in DAD total score of \>=12., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (European Union Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose increase (worsening) in ADAS-Cog/11 total score from baseline to Week 78 was at most 0, 3, 7 points., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose increase (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score is \<7., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in DAD Total Score at Week 78 (European Union Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score was at most 0, 6, 12 points., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in DAD Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score was \<12., 78 weeks|Change From Baseline in Dependence Scale Total Score at Week 78, The Dependence Scale (DS) is a 13-item, caregiver-rated instrument for determining the amount of support required by a participant with AD. The DS total score ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating more need for assistance. The DS was administered as an interview to the caregiver at scheduled study visits., 78 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 78, The CDR-SOB is a global clinical staging instrument that sums 6 clinical ratings: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) interview. The CDR includes discussions with the participant and caregiver using a structured format.

The memory domain is considered the primary category that drives the CDR global outcome, and all other domains are secondary. The CDR global score ranges from 0 to 3 (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia)., From Loss of 1 Global Stage through Week 78|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline NPI score, age at baseline, and baseline NPI score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's global cognitive function.

LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Amyloid deposition in the brain is one of the defining neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by florbetapir amyloid PET imaging in a subset of participants. The Centiloid scale standardizes quantitative brain amyloid PET results to allow cross-tracer and cross-methodology comparisons. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans. Florbetapir SUVr was converted to the Centiloid scale using the following conversion: Florbetapir Centiloids = 183 x SUVr - 177. LS Mean was determined by using ANCOVA methodology with terms for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) Using Florbetapir Perfusion Scan, Florbetapir perfusion evaluated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a biomarker of brain function and was performed at the same time as the amyloid florbetapir PET. Cerebral perfusion, especially in temporal and parietal areas, is reduced in AD and this pattern of hypoperfusion closely mirrors the hypometabolism pattern observed using FDG PET. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF (last observation carried forward) and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Whole Brain Volume, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the effect of lanabecestat on brain atrophy/whole brain volumes. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI), intracranial volume and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Population Pharmacokinetics (PK): Apparent Oral Clearance of Lanabecestat, The apparent oral clearance of lanabecestat was estimated using a population approach.

NCT04010175,Digital Cognitive Remote Training in Alzheimer's Disease (MA-EIAD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04010175,DCRT-AD,TERMINATED,"Cerebral functioning changes with age in order to respond to the impacts of different external and internal factors on the brain, and more generally on the human body. Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that during life the brain develops specific neural networks to handle with cognitive activities. When these networks are impaired due to factors that damage brain structure and/or brain functioning, the brain adapts and elaborates new networks to cope with this situation. A cognitive reserve built throughout life and an appropriated care such as for example cognitive training, are in the centre of this model because they are involved in building these networks. In general, studies exploring cognitive training in normal aging and in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease have shown some benefits of the training on cognitive functioning. It has been shown not only that the cognitive training improves older adults' cognition, but also that these effects last for a long time and positively influence older people everyday activities. In fact, the benefits from memory training were observed 5 years after the end of the training and those of reasoning and of speed of processing even after 10 years. In addition, majority of the participants declared to notice improvement of their everyday life. Concerning Alzheimer's disease, several studies have observed positive results of cognitive training although there are some controversies about its' effects. Numerous studies point out that for cognitive training being the most efficient, the intervention has to take place as early as possible, preferentially in a premorbid stage of the disease and that it is important to propose trainings that minimize the withdrawal. In this sense, the importance of using computer based training was put forward because it allows the elaboration of multiple exercises with playful aspect and more importantly it can adapt on line the difficulty of the exercises to the patient's performance. However, if it is commonly admitted that computer based training has an important role in physician's, psychologist's or speech therapist's office less is known about the efficiency of this type of training performed at distance, at the patient's place of residence. It seems probable that to propose distance training as an additional training to that performed in a practitioner's office would increase training benefits. To investigators knowledge this was not investigated in a systematic way with Alzheimer's disease patients. The more important advantages of a such additional training are: (1) reduction of patients' travelling, (2) increased flexibility of training scheduling and (3) increased frequency of training sessions per week.

Thus, in the present study investigators will examine in a systematic way, whether the distance training, as an additional training to this performed in practitioner's office, brings incremental short- and long-term benefits coming from cognitive training in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. Investigators second objective is to determine what would be the best frequency per week of such an additional training.",NO,Alzheimer Disease,BEHAVIORAL: Control - Cognitive training in a practitioner's office one time per week|BEHAVIORAL: Experimental group 1 - Cognitive training in a practitioner's office one time per week and cognitive distance training one time per week|BEHAVIORAL: Experimental group 2 - Cognitive training in a practitioner's office one time per week and cognitive distance training four times per week,"Influence of the training on experimental tasks, To evaluate benefits of cognitive training the scores of four experimental tasks will be combined.

Functional nonresponders are participants who have not had any of the following at any time point: Clinically evident decline in ability to perform one or more basic ADL present at baseline; A clinically evident decline in ability to perform 20% or more of the instrumental ADL present at baseline; An increase in global CDR score of 1 point or more compared with baseline. A decline from no impairment to mild impairment (bADL, iADL is not considered clinically significant, but other declines of 1 or more points and any participant discontinuation within the first 6 months will be considered a non-responder., Baseline through Week 80|Change From Baseline in Plasma Amyloid-Beta (Aβ) Species, Concentration of amino acid peptide known as Aβ 1-42 in plasma. The change in plasma Aβ analytes after treatment were assessed separately for each plasma Aβ parameter. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI), The vMRI assessment of right and left hippocampal atrophy, is reported. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of Solanezumab (LY2062430), Area Under the Concentration versus Time Curve was evaluated for Solanezumab., Visit 2 (Post-dose), Visit 5, 9, 15 (Pre-dose, Post-dose) and Visit 22 (Pre-dose): Pre-dose before the infusion, Post-dose 30 minutes End of Infusion|Change From Baseline in Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Florbetapir PET imaging was used to confirm the presence of amyloid pathology consistent with AD. Change from baseline was done to test the hypothesis that amyloid burden was reduced in participants in the treatment group. The change from baseline to the postbaseline visit of the composite summary standard uptake value ratio of florbetapir F18 was calculated. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit. The composite summary measure is an unweighted average of the 6 smaller regions (anterior cingulate, frontal medial orbital, parietal, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal) normalized to whole cerebellum or subject-specific white matter., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Aβ Levels, Concentration of CSF parameters includes amino acid peptide known as Aβ 1-42 and Aβ 1-42. Analyses of these CSF biomarkers was conducted in a subset of participants (as an addendum to the protocol). The dependent variable for each CSF parameter was its change from baseline to endpoint.

MMSE is composed of 30 questions grouped into domains (Orientation to Time \[0-5\], Orientation to Place \[0-5\], Registration \[0-3\], Attention and Calculation \[0-5\], Recall \[0-3\], Naming \[0-2\], Repetition \[0-1\], Comprehension \[0-3\], Reading \[0-1\], Writing \[0-1\], Drawing \[0-1\]). For each of the MMSE domains, six items are computed (Orientation to Time \[0-5\], Orientation to Place \[0-5\], Registration \[0-3\], Attention and Calculation \[0-5\], Recall \[0-3\], Language: Naming, Repetition, Comprehension, Reading, Writing, and Drawing \[0-9\]). The MMSE Total Score is the sum of the six domains and ranges from 0 to 30. If any domain score was missing then the total score was missing. Higher score indicates better function., Baseline (Day 1: before first dose in the core phase) up to Month 24 of the core phase|Core Phase: Change From Baseline up to Month 24 in the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) Score, FAQ scores 10 items \& measures activities of daily living (paying bills/balancing checkbook, assembling tax records, shopping alone for clothes or groceries, playing game of skill such as bridge or chess/working on a hobby, heating water \& turning off stove, preparing balanced meal, keeping track of current events, paying attention \& understanding television program, remembering appointments, driving or traveling out of neighborhood). Each item is rated as follows: 0=Normal, 1=Has difficulty but does by self, 2=Requires assistance, 3=Dependent, or 8=Not Applicable. The total score is the sum of all 10 items \& ranges from 0 to 30. Higher score indicates more impairment. If any activity was missed, then the total score was missed. Activities rated as ""Not Applicable"" were not used in the computation of the total score. To account for ""Not Applicable"" activity, the total score was weighted as:Total Score=Total Score\*30/(30 minus 3 times the number of activities marked""Not Applicable"")., Baseline (Day 1: before first dose in the core phase) up to Month 24 of the core phase|Core Phase: Change From Baseline up to Month 24 in the ADAS-cog14 Word List (Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall) Score, The ADAS-cog14 Word List is a summation of two items: ""Immediate Word-recall"" and ""Delayed Word-recall"".

The cognitive subscale items capture word recall, ability to follow commands, the ability to correctly copy or draw an image, naming, the ability to interact with everyday objects, orientation, word recognition, memory, comprehension of spoken language, word-finding, and language ability, with a measure for delayed word recall and concentration/distractibility. The total score ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate worse performance. A positive change from baseline indicates decline in cognitive performance., Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106|Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Scale Score at Weeks 78 and 106, The MMSE scale is a performance-based test of global cognitive status. It consists of 11 tasks that assess orientation, word recall, attention and calculation, language abilities, and visuospatial functions. The scores from the 11 tests are combined to obtain the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate better performance. A negative change from baseline indicates decline in cognitive performance., Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 (NPI-10) Score at Weeks 78 and 106, The NPI-10 is a questionnaire administered to the informant, designed to obtain information on the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and behaviors in a participant with Alzheimer's disease. Ten areas are assessed: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behavior. The NPI total score ranges from 0 to 120. Higher scores indicate greater impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement (symptom reduction)., Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106|Change From Baseline in Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Signal at Weeks 78 and 104, Amyloid PET scan assesses cerebral amyloid load using radiotracers which is standardized into centiloids. Centiloid values on centiloid scale is based on mean composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)., Baseline, Weeks 78 and 104|Change From Baseline in Tau PET Signal at Weeks 78 and 104, The cerebral tau level was measured by tau PET imaging. Tau PET imaging was conducted using radiotracer. SUVR is a ratio of PET uptake measured in brain region of interest and a disease-free reference region. A higher SUVR is an indication of increased PET radiotracer uptake and worsening disease., Baseline, Weeks 78 and 104|Change From Baseline in CDR-SB Score at Week 106, The CDR integrates assessments from 3 domains of cognition (memory, orientation, judgment/problem-solving) and 3 domains of function (community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care). Following caregiver interview and systematic participant examination, the rater assigns a score describing the participant's current performance level in each of these domains of life functioning. The CDR-SB sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates greater impairment., Baseline, Week 106|Change From Baseline in Global Statistical Test (GST) Composite Z-Score at Weeks 78 and 106, GST z-score is an average of z-scores of CDR-SB, ADASCog13 and ADCS-ADL-MCI. CDR-SB assesses 3 cognitive (memory,orientation, judgment/problem-solving)and 3 functional(community affairs,home/hobbies,personal care) domains. Sum of Boxes method combines scores across 6 domains, ranging from 0-18(higher scores=greater impairment). ADAS-Cog13 evaluates cognitive tasks like word recall, naming, orientation and memory, with scores from 0-85 (higher scores=worse performance). ADCS-ADL-MCI rates 17 tasks (e.g.,shopping, preparing meal) and 1 basic task(dressing) with scores from 0-53 (higher scores=greater independence/healthy functioning). z-score\>0 indicates greater impairment/worse performance for CDR-SB and ADASCog13 scales and improved functioning for ADCS-ADL-MCI. For ADCS-ADL-MCI, z-score were reversed (new reversed value=original value-1) to make interpretation consistent. The GST z-score of 0 indicates population mean and score\>0 indicate greater impairment/worse performance., Baseline, Weeks 78 and 106",,Biogen,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1027,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",221AD305|2022-001671-14,2022-06-02,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,2022-04-04,2025-04-23,2025-04-23,"Gilbert Neurology Partners, PLLC, Gilbert, Arizona, 85297, United States|Xenoscience Inc., Phoenix, Arizona, 85004, United States|Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006, United States|Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|HonorHealth Neurology, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85251, United States|Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, Arizona, 85351, United States|Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Tucson, Arizona, 85012, United States|Health Initiatives Research, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Sun Valley Behaivoral Med Center, El Centro, California, 92243, United States|Neuropain Medical Center, Fresno, California, 93710, United States|Neurology Center of North Orange County, Fullerton, California, 92835, United States|Irvine Center for Clinical Research, Inc., Irvine, California, 92614, United States|Mary S.

Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, feeder visit 1 MMSE status (mild/moderate), concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment\*visit., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes in dementia. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144. Lower scores indicated less severity and higher scores indicated a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment\*visit., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Resource Utilization in Dementia - Lite (RUD-Lite) Caregiver Hours, The RUD-Lite is a caregiver-completed assessment designed to assess the amount of formal and informal resources used by participants and the primary caregiver. It is completed by the caregiver and compiles data on the following resources: length of time the caregiver spends giving care, assisting participants with basic activities of daily living (BADL: eating dressing, grooming, bathing); assisting participants with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs: shopping, cooking, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication, managing finances), and providing supervision. Scores range from 0 to 24 hours. Higher values indicate greater resource use. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment\*visit., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Version (EQ-5D Proxy), EQ-5D (proxy version) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument assessing caregiver's impression of participants overall health state. Profile allows caregivers to rate participant's health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale: 1 (no problem), 2 (some problems), and 3 (major problems). These attribute combinations are converted into a weighted Health-State Index Score according to the United States (US) population-based algorithm. EQ-5D US Population-Based Index Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0. A score of 1.0 indicated perfect health. The Overall Health State Index Score is caregiver-reported using a visual analogue scale marked 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health state). LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment\*visit., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD), The QoL-AD (Caregiver Total Score) is a disease-specific measure of quality of life for an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) population administered to the participant's primary caregiver, who answers on behalf of the participant. The assessment consists of 13 items covering physical health, energy, mood, living situations, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self and life as a whole. The assessment is scored on a 4-point Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). QoL-AD Total Score is defined as the sum of the 13 items with a scores range from 13 to 52. Higher scores denote a better quality of life. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment\*visit., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's cognitive function. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention with scores ranging from 0 to 21 (lower scores indicate greater impairment). The second section tests the ability of the participant to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures with scores ranging from 0 to 9 (lower scores indicate greater impairment). The range for MMSE Total Score is 0 to 30. Lower scores indicate more impairment.

NCT02080364,Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Azeliragon (TTP488) in Patients With Mild Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02080364,STEADFAST,TERMINATED,This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azeliragon in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Patients will receive either azeliragon or placebo with a patient's participation lasting approximately 18 months.,YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Azeliragon|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-cog) Total Score, The ADAS-cog is a structured scale (approximately 40 minutes to complete) that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and constructional praxis (Rosen, 1984). The ADAS-cog scoring range for the version used in this study is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months (B-Study)|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb), The CDR scale is used as a global measure of dementia and is completed by a clinician in the setting of detailed knowledge of the individual patient collected from interviews with the patient and caregiver (Berg, 1988). The CDR describes 5 degrees of impairment in performance on each of 6 categories including memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. CDR ratings are 0 for healthy individuals, 0.5 for questionable dementia and 1, 2 and 3 for mild, moderate and severe dementia as defined in the CDR scale. The scores for each category can also be summed and this is known as the sum of box score (CSR-SB). Sum of box scores range from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months (B-Study)","Change From Baseline in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Brain Volumetric Measures, Percent of Total Hippocampus Atrophy to Intracranial Volume, Baseline and 18 months|Change From Baseline in the Normalized Mean Composite SUVR of the 5 Regions, Extent and severity of brain hypometabolism was assessed centrally at Baseline and Month 18. SUVR PET was designed to make use of FreeSurfer-based segmentations of the brain obtained using the 3DT1 MRI. Following the methods published by Landau and Jagust (Landau SM, Annals of Neurology 2012) and described on the ADNI website (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis-method/), regions were defined in native patient space on the 3DT1 MRI acquired at the Baseline visit and at Month 18 visit. An SUVR measure was computed regionally over five sub-regions (anterior/posterior cingulate, temporal, parietal, frontal and hippocampal areas), normalized to activity in the cerebral white matter. These sub-regions were selected to optimize sensitivity in longitudinal studies. This outcome measure presents the change from baseline in the normalized mean composite SUVR of the 5 regions. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease (worsening) in brain glucose metabolism/utilization., Baseline to 18 months|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), The ADCS-ADL is an activity of daily living inventory developed by the ADCS to assess functional performance in participants with AD (Galasko et al., 1997). Informants are queried via a structured interview format as to whether participants attempted each item in the inventory during the preceding 4 weeks, as well as their level of performance. Scores range from 0-78 with lower scores indicating greater functional impairment., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months (B-Study)|Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is a brief 30-point test that is used to assess cognition (Folstein, 1975). It is commonly used to screen for dementia. In the time span of about 10 minutes, it samples various functions, including arithmetic, memory and orientation. Scores range from 0-30 with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months (B-Study)|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), The NPI is a well-validated, reliable, multi-item instrument to assess psychopathology in AD based on an interview with the caregiver (Cummings et al, 1994). It evaluates both the frequency and severity of 12 behavioral areas including delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria (depression) anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability, lability, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, appetite and eating changes and night-time behaviors.

Frequency assessments range from 1 (occasionally, less than once per week) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per day or continuously) as well as severity (1= mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Distress is rated by the study partner or caregiver and ranges from 0 (no distress) to 5 (very severe or extreme). The overall score and the score for each subscale are the product of severity and frequency. Scores range from 0-144 with higher scores indicating a greater presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months (B-Study)|Change From Baseline in Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL), The DEMQOL-Proxy questionnaire is a validated and reliable questionnaire that is interview administered and completed by the caregiver about the patient's health related quality of life (Smith et al, 2005). It consists of 31 items representing 5 domains (daily activities and looking after yourself, health and well-being, cognitive functioning, social relationships, and self-concept) and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. Scores range 31-124 with higher scores indicate better health related quality of life., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months (B-Study)|Change From Baseline in Continuous Oral Word Association Task (COWAT), The COWAT is a measure of verbal fluency in which the participant is asked to generate orally as many words as possible that begin with the letters ""F"", ""A"", and ""S"", excluding proper names and different forms of the same word. (Borkowski, 1967, Loonstra 2001) For each letter, the participant is allowed one minute to generate the words. Performance is measured by the total number of correct words produced summed across the three letters. Perseverations (i.e., repetitions of a correct word) and intrusions (i.e., words not beginning with the designated letter) are noted., Baseline and 18 months (A-Study); baseline and 12 months

The study will test the hypothesis that lanabecestat is a disease-modifying treatment for participants with early Alzheimer´s disease, defined as the continuum of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer´s disease and participants diagnosed with mild dementia of the Alzheimer´s type, as measured by change from baseline on the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) score at week 104 in each of the 2 lanabecestat treatment groups compared with placebo.",YES,Alzheimer´s Disease,DRUG: Lanabecestat|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline on the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), ADAS-Cog13 (13-item version of ADAS-Cog) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates word recall, ability to follow commands, constructional praxis, naming, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, memory, comprehension of spoken language, word-finding, and language ability, with a measure of delayed word recall and concentration/ distractibility. The total score of the 13-item scale ranges from 0 to 85, with an increase in score indicating cognitive worsening. Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline, pooled country, and covariates for baseline ADAS-Cog13 total score, age at baseline, and baseline ADAS-Cog13 total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 104","Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer´s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Instrumental Items (ADCS-iADL), The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, pooled country, and covariates for baseline for baseline iADL score, age at baseline, and baseline iADL score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Score, FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-based questionnaire and was administered to the study partner who was asked to rate the participant's ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from writing checks, assembling tax records, shopping, playing games, food preparation, traveling, keeping appointments, traveling out of neighborhood, keeping track of current events and understanding media. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. Each activity is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (Never did and would have difficulty now = 1; Never did \[the activity\] but could do now = 0; Normal = 0; Has difficulty but does by self = 1; Requires assistance = 2; Dependent = 3). FAQ scale is 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was calculated by MMRM with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline and pooled country., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score, The iADRS is a composite that measures both cognition and function. The iADRS comprises scores form the ADAS- Cog and the ADCS-iADL. The iADRS is calculated as a linear combination of the total scores of the ADAS-Cog13 (score range 0 to 85 with higher scores reflecting worse performance) and the ADCS-iADL (score range from 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance). The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by- visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, pooled country, and covariates for baseline iADRS13 total score, age at baseline, and baseline iADRS13 total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, The CDR-SB is a rater administered scale and impairment is scored in of the following categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment is scored on a scale in which no dementia = 0, questionable dementia = 0.5, mild dementia = 1, moderate dementia = 2 and severe dementia = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or ""box scores"", were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, pooled country, and covariates for baseline CDR-SB score, age at baseline, and baseline CDR-SB score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 104|Time to Progression as Measured by Loss of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Global Score Stage, The CDR global score is a composite score calculated using the Washington University CDR-assignment algorithm applied to the 6 individual domain box scores (Morris 1993). The memory domain is considered the primary category that drives the CDR global outcome, and all other domains are secondary. The CDR global score ranges from 0 to 3 (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia)., Baseline through Loss of 1 Global Stage or Week 104|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, pooled country, and covariates for baseline NPI score, age at baseline, and baseline NPI score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's global cognitive function. The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall of words, attention and calculation, language (naming, comprehension and repetition), and spatial ability (copying a figure). The range for MMSE total Score is 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive performance. LS mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, pooled country, and covariates for baseline MMSE total score, age at baseline, and baseline MMSE total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 104|Pharmacodynamics (PD): Percent Change From Baseline in Concentration of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarker Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-42, Concentration of the peptide Aβ 1-42 in plasma measured by validated immunoassay.

LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, disease status at baseline, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 97|Change From Baseline in CSF Phosphorylated Tau, Cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected for analysis of concentrations of phosphorylated tau. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, disease status at baseline, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 97|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Amyloid deposition in the brain is one of the defining neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by florbetapir amyloid PET imaging in a subset of participants. The Centiloid scale standardizes quantitative brain amyloid PET results to allow cross-tracer and cross-methodology comparisons. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans. Florbetapir SUVr was converted to the Centiloid scale using the following conversion: Florbetapir Centiloids = 183 x SUVr - 177. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA methodology with factors for treatment, disease status at baseline, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline in Tau PET ((Flortaucipir F18), Tau PET tracer (flortaucipir F18) longitudinal study measured whether lanabecestat, in participants with mild AD dementia, affected tau density and distribution over time. The outcome reported is the composite summary of the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) normalized to the signal intensity in white matter. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA methodology with factors for treatment, disease status at baseline, baseline biomarker and age at baseline. Baseline defined to be within 28 days of starting study drug., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline in Brain Metabolism Using Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET evaluates the regional brain metabolic rates for glucose as a sensitive, in vivo metabolic index of brain function. The outcome reported is the composite summary of the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) normalized to the pons + vermis assessed with composite meta and composite meta automated anatomical labeling atlas (ALL). Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365.

NCT01852110,Efficacy and Safety of MK-7622 as Adjunct Therapy in Participants With Alzheimer's Disease (MK-7622-012),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01852110,,TERMINATED,"The purpose of this multicenter trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-7622 compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) for the symptomatic treatment of participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The trial consists of two stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. In Stage 1, participants will be randomized to receive either placebo or MK-7622 45 mg once daily. In Stage 2, participants will be randomized to receive either placebo or MK-7622 (dose: 5, 15 or 45 mg once daily). Participants will be enrolled in only one stage; the duration of each stage is approximately 26 weeks. Interim analyses will be performed in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 to determine whether the trial should continue. The primary study hypotheses are the following: Stage 1 - MK-7622 45 mg once daily is superior to placebo with respect to improving cognition in participants with mild to moderate AD as assessed by mean change from baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) at Week 12; Stage 2 - At least one of the top two doses of MK-7622 (15 mg once daily, 45 mg once daily) is superior to placebo with respect to improving cognition in participants with mild to moderate AD as assessed by mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11 at Week 12.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: MK-7622|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: AChEI,"Change From Baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) Score at Week 12 (Stage 1, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo), Mean change from baseline at week 12 was assessed for ADAS-Cog11 score. ADAS-Cog11 measures cognition by assessing 11 metrics impaired in Alzheimer's Disease (AD): speech; speech comprehension; word finding; word recall; object/finger naming; orientation; obeying commands; ideational praxis; constructional praxis; word recognition; and remembering instruction. For each metric, scores range from 0 (no impairment) to (depending on the metric) either 5 (8 metrics), 8, 10, or 12 (1 metric each); higher scores indicate more severe impairment. Individual scores sum to a total ADAS-Cog11 score, ranging from 0-70. Higher total scores indicate greater cognitive impairment and AD severity. Further, increases in AD severity over time would be reflected by increases in ADAS-Cog11 score., Baseline and week 12|Change From Baseline in ADAS-Cog11 Score at Week 12 (Stage 2, MK-7622 45 mg and 15 mg Versus Placebo), Mean change from baseline at week 12 was assessed for ADAS-Cog11 score.

For each metric, scores range from 0 (no impairment) to (depending on the metric) either 5 (8 metrics), 8, 10, or 12 (1 metric each); higher scores indicate more severe impairment. Individual scores sum to a total ADAS-Cog11 score, ranging from 0-70. Higher total scores indicate greater cognitive impairment and AD severity. Further, increases in AD severity over time would be reflected by increases in ADAS-Cog11 score., Baseline and week 12|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), The number of participants experiencing an adverse event (AE) was assessed. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence, symptom, or disease witnessed in a participant, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study treatment can be demonstrated. Further, any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study treatment is also considered an AE., Up to 26 weeks|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, The number of participants discontinuing study drug due to an AE was assessed., Up to 24 weeks","Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) at Week 24 (Combining Stage 1 and 2, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo), Mean change from baseline at week 24 was assessed for ADCS-ADL score. The ADCS-ADL score measures the performance of activities of daily living, calculated from a 24-question survey. For each of the 24 questions, scores range from 0 (no independence) to (depending on the question) either 2 (1 question), 3 (17 questions), 4 (5 questions), or 5 (1 question), with higher scores indicating greater independence in activity performance.

The CDR-SB score is a clinical rating of global cognitive function, comprised of 6 domains including: memory; orientation; judgment and problem solving; community affairs; home and hobbies; and personal care. For each domain, the degree of impairment is assessed by a semi-structured interview of the participant as well as the participant's caregiver. For each domain, potential scores range from 0 (no impairment) to 3 (severe impairment). Scores from each individual domain are summed to the total CDR-SB score, with total scores ranging from 0-18. Higher scores indicate more severe cognitive impairment. Further, increases in cognitive impairment would be reflected by increases in CDR-SB score., Baseline and week 78|[Part I (Base Study)] Percent Change From Baseline in Total Hippocampal Volume (THV), Least squares mean percent change from baseline at week 78 was calculated for Total Hippocampal Volume (THV) as measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI). Longitudinal analysis of within-participant THV is computed using a change analysis algorithm using tensor-based morphometry. This technique produces one measure of volume change calculated from the registration of serial vMRI scans at the follow-up time point relative to baseline. Negative percent changes from baseline indicate decreases in THV (i.e. increased hippocampal atrophy)., Baseline and week 78|[Part I (Base Study)] Fold Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Total Tau, Least squares mean fold change from baseline at week 78 was calculated for Total Tau concentration in CSF, a measure of brain tau pathology. Per protocol, CSF Total Tau concentration was analyzed as part of a substudy in Part I, with testing occurring only at select trial sites. Least squares mean fold change from baseline \>1 indicates increased Total Tau concentration in the CSF., Baseline and week 78|[Part I (Base Study)] Change From Baseline in Cortical Amyloid Load Assessed by [18F]Flutemetamol PET Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR), Least squares mean change from baseline at week 78 was calculated for SUVR, a measure of brain cortical amyloid load. Per protocol, SUVR was analyzed as part of a substudy in Part I, with testing occurring only at select trial sites. Participants receive the PET tracer \[18F\]Flutemetamol (IV). After 90 minutes, participants receive 4 PET scans (5 minutes each in duration). Using these PET scan images, specific brain ROIs (frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes; anterior and posterior cingulate and precuneus) are used to calculate regional SUVRs, defined as the relative ratio of pixel intensities at a specific ROI compared to a reference region (RR; subcortical white matter). These regional SUVRs are then averaged to compute a composite cortical SUVR for each participant. Higher composite cortical SUVR values indicate increased amyloid load, with negative changes in composite cortical SUVR over time indicating decreases in brain amyloid load., Baseline and week 78|[Part I (Base Study)] Percentage of Participants Achieving Responder Status, The percentage of participants achieving responder status at week 78 was assessed. To determine which participants were considered responders, a linear regression was conducted at the participant level, yielding an estimated 78-week rate of change (i.e., a slope) for each participant with respect to ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL. To be declared a responder, a participant must have: 1) ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL observations at baseline and 78 weeks of treatment; 2) an ADAS-Cog slope \> 4.0 over 78 weeks, and 3) an ADCS-ADL slope \> -6.3 over 78 weeks. A participant failing to meet any of these criteria was designated as a non-responder at Week 78., Week 78|[Part I (Base Study)] Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, Least squares mean change from baseline at week 78 was assessed for NPI score. NPI is a clinical assessment of psychiatric status, covering 12 domains: delusion; hallucination; agitation/aggression; depression/dysphoria; anxiety; elation/euphoria; apathy/indifference; disinhibition; irritability/lability; aberrant motor behavior; sleep/nighttime behaviors; and appetite/eating disorders. Based on an interview of the participant's caregiver, each domain is assessed for symptom frequency \[range: 1 (occasional) to 4 (very frequent)\] and severity \[range: 1 (mild) to 3 (severe)\]. Domain scores \[range: 0 to 12\] are calculated as the product of the frequency and severity scores (i.e. frequency x severity); if no symptoms are present, domain score is 0. The 12 domain scores sum to a total NPI score \[range: 0 (no symptoms in any domain) to 144\]. Higher scores reflect more severe psychiatric impairment, with increases in impairment reflected by increases in NPI score., Baseline and week 78|[Part I (Base Study)] Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score, Least squares mean change from baseline at week 78 was assessed for MMSE score. The MMSE is a cognitive assessment of 5 domains including: orientation; attention; memory; language; and constructional praxis. These domains are assessed over the course of 11 total questions related to the participant. Participants are scored based on the number of correct responses; depending on the question, potential scores range from 0 (no correct response) to either 1 (4 questions), 2 (1 question), 3 (3 questions), or 5 (3 questions). Scores from each question are summed to the total MMSE score, with total scores ranging from 0-30. Higher scores indicate better cognitive performance.

The severity of each neuropsychiatric symptom is rated on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate and marked). The total severity score range is from 0 to 36 with higher scores representing higher severity. Difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 53 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region and the use/non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline., Baseline, Week 53|Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) Scale Score, The QoL-AD (Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease) scale assesses QoL in participants who have dementia. The QoL-AD consists of 13 items covering aspects of participants' relationships with friends and family, physical condition, mood, concerns about finances and overall assessment of QoL. Items are rated on 4-point Likert-type scales ranging from 1 \[poor\] to 4 \[excellent\]. The score range is from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating a better QoL. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline., Baseline, Week 77|Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease (ZCI-AD) Scale Score, The ZCI-AD is a modified version of the Zarit Burden Interview, which was originally designed to reflect the stresses experienced by caregivers of people with dementia. This modified version includes slight modifications in item and title wording (e.g., removal of ""your relative"" to refer directly to the patient, removal of ""burden"" from title) and the use of 11-point numerical rating scales. The ZCI-AD scale consists of a total of 30 items. Total scores will be calculated with a total score range from 0 to 300 (higher scores indicate a higher burden on the caregiver). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 53 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline., Baseline, Week 53|European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire Domain Scores for Participants, The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status designed to provide a simple generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It is broadly applicable across a wide range of health conditions and treatment. The EQ-5D assesses five domains to provide a health state index. These are anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort, usual activities, mobility, and self-care. The scores on the EQ-5D ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated.

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline up until 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to 117 weeks).|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Crenezumab Antibodies, Participants were considered positive or negative for ADA based on their baseline and post-baseline sample results. The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined for Crenezumab and Placebo groups. The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels at baseline relative to the total number of participants with a sample available at baseline. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was determined as the proportion of participants with confirmed post-baseline positive ADAs relative to the total number of participants that had at least one post-baseline sample available for ADA analysis., Baseline up to Week 105|Serum Concentration of Crenezumab, Serum concentration data for Crenezumab will be tabulated and summarized.

NCT00299988,Phase II Study of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00299988,,TERMINATED,"The overall goal of this double-blind Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological mechanisms of action of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). IVIg contains antibodies against the amyloid beta protein that is the central component of the AD senile plaque. It is hypothesized that IVIg treatment will reduce the levels of beta amyloid in the brain and improve cognitive abilities relative to placebo.
