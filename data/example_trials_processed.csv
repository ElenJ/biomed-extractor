NCT00299988,"The overall goal of this double-blind Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological mechanisms of action of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). IVIg contains antibodies against the amyloid beta protein that is the central component of the AD senile plaque. It is hypothesized that IVIg treatment will reduce the levels of beta amyloid in the brain and improve cognitive abilities relative to placebo. A total of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD capable of giving informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive either IVIg (16 patients)or saline placebo (8 patients) for six months. This study includes comparison of four dosing regimens of IVIg. Cognitive, behavioral and functional measures will be collected at baseline, three months and six months of treatment. Plasma samples will be collected before and after infusions. Subjects will undergo a lumbar puncture before and after the six months of treatment for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses. In addition, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Following the initial 6 month placebo-controlled period, all participants have the opportunity to receive IVIg for an additional 12 month period in an extension study.","Abnormal processing of the beta-amyloid protein is thought to be an early and causative event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeting beta amyloid (Aβ) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to arrest and even reverse elements of AD brain pathology. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a medication obtained from the pooled plasma of healthy human blood donors that contains natural anti-amyloid antibodies and exhibits potent central nervous system anti-inflammatory properties. IVIg has been FDA-approved and used for more than 25 years in patients with a variety of immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases and has an established safety record, but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of AD.

A total of 24 patients, males and females 50 years of age and older, with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be enrolled in this research study. To be eligible, patients must meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. After written informed consent is obtained, subjects will go through a screening process to determine if he or she meets the inclusion criteria. Screening procedures include medical history, blood and urine tests, neurologic exam, chest x-ray and MRI. Women who want to take part in this study must either be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or agree to avoid becoming pregnant during the entire period of their participation in this study.

To be eligible for this research study, patients must be taking a stable dose of an approved AD medication for at least 3 months prior to entering this study or be unable to take these medications. The design of this protocol is that of an add-on study and we will recommend patients continue to take any FDA-approved AD medications they are taking at study entry.

Subjects' participation in the study will last approximately 19 months, including screening and baseline procedures, treatment with study drug and a follow-up visit 1 ½ months after finishing treatment, plus a visit for blood tests 6 months after the last infusion in the study. This research study requires that the patient have another person, (such as a spouse, child, other relative, close friend, aide or other professional caregiver), who will accompany the patient to each clinic visit.

Subjects will be randomized to a treatment group for 6 months of infusions of IVIg or placebo. The treatment groups compare different doses and frequencies of treatment. Patients will have a 33% chance of receiving placebo.

Blood will be obtained from subjects every two weeks and examined in our research laboratories to obtain more information about IVIg's biological effects. Cerebrospinal fluid will be obtained by lumbar puncture twice over the course of the study for the same purpose. Patients will be asked to allow a portion of a blood sample to be used for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing and banked for genetic research testing related to AD and aging, but do not have to participate in the testing or allow their blood sample to be stored in order to take part in the study.

Cognitive testing will be carried out at baseline and every three months over a period of 18 months. Results of cognitive testing will constitute the primary endpoint of this study. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Safety laboratories and assessments will be carried out at regular intervals.

NCT00369603,The purpose of this study is to determine whether standard medications approved for Alzheimer's disease treatment differ in their action on brain functioning and whether any observed brain activity differences as result of treatment are associated with particular patterns of dementia improvement or reduced decline.,"This study seeks to differentiate task-related and resting brain activity patterns captured via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and associated with two common Alzheimer's disease (AD) medications, equivalent in acetylcholinesterase inhibition effect (AChEI) but differing with respect to allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation effect. It is the primary aim of this project to gain a better understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in the attentional and executive skills improvements associated with nicotinic receptor modulation in mild AD patients.

To address this question, this 12-week continuous treatment, double-blind, head-to-head dose-escalation treatment trial seeks to visualize any treatment response unique to allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation and to associate these fMRI data with standard cognitive assessment outcomes. Using in-scanner tasks shown to reliably elicit brain activity in cortical regions important to memory and attention, this treatment trial will examine both resting and task-related BOLD signal characteristics in a well-characterized sample of 36 mild AD patients after periods of low dose and high dose AD dementia treatment with either galantamine hydrobromide (AChEI + nicotinic receptor modulation) or donepezil hydrochloride (AChEI only). Both the low and high dose imaging comparisons between treatment groups will be equivalent for 35% AChEI-effect, which may allow for the isolation of BOLD signal unique to allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation in both brain at rest and task-related brain states.","must meet diagnosis of mild alzheimer's disease; must have a family member or caregiver who is willing to attend all study visits and provide information on your participation in the study; if female, must be post-menopausal; must be able to swallow tablets","metal implants or medical devises unsafe for mri use; pre-menopausal female; history of recent head injury; significant major, life-threatening illness or injury (e.g., stroke, aids, etc.); vascular dementia or any dementia other than alzheimer's disease; history of significant alcoholism or drug abuse; history of seizure disorder, developmental delay or major psychiatric illness",Razadyne ER; Aricept,"Brain activity patterns, as collected via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), at rest and associated with task performance after 4 weeks of low-dose treatment and after 8-weeks of higher-dose treatment."

NCT00679627,The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 years of treatment with galantamine as compared with placebo of patients who have mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD).,"This is a long-term (2-year), randomized (patients will be assigned to treatment by chance), double blind (neither the physician nor the patient will know which treatment is assigned) study of galantamine versus placebo in subjects with mild to moderately-severe AD. Approximately 2,000 patients will participate in this study. The study length for each patient is approximately 25.5 months. The study consists of 3 phases: a pretreatment phase, a treatment phase, and a posttreatment phase. The pretreatment phase includes a 2-week screening period (to obtain a patient's and his or her caregiver's informed consent and to confirm eligibility for the study) and a baseline visit at which subjects will be randomly assigned, in a 1 to 1 ratio, to receive either galantamine or placebo once a day in the morning. Study drug will first be dispensed at the baseline visit. The treatment phase is composed of a titration period (the study drug will be introduced gradually) and a maintenance period and includes 9 visits (3 of which are conducted by telephone). The titration period is 12 weeks long, and visits occur about every 28 days. In the first 4 weeks of the titration period, subjects will receive either 8 mg galantamine or matching placebo, and this dose will be increased to 16 mg galantamine or placebo in the second 4 weeks. The dose will then be increased to 24 mg galantamine or placebo for the final 4 weeks of the titration period if the investigator believes the subject will benefit from and will safely tolerate 24 mg/day. If not, the subject may continue to receive 16 mg galantamine or placebo through the end of the titration period. After the titration period, subjects will enter the maintenance period and continue to take study drug at the dosage they received at the end of the titration period. This dosage may be continued through the end of the study or may be changed once (either up from 16 to 24 mg or down from 24 to 16 mg), depending upon the benefit and the safety of such a change for the individual patient as judged by the investigator. No dosage will exceed 24 mg/day. The posttreatment phase includes an End-of-Study Visit that occurs at the end of the maintenance period. A follow-up telephone contact (interview) is conducted 1 month after the End-of-Study Visit. The effectiveness of galantamine will be evaluated using the following tools: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); the Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD); and the Assessment of Patient Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden (APAS CarB). Safety evaluations for the study include the monitoring of vital status and institutionalization status, adverse events, vital signs, weight, physical and neurologic examinations. A Data Safety Monitoring Board, external to the company, has been commissioned for this study to monitor the progress of the study and to ensure that the safety of patients is not compromised. The effectiveness hypothesis of this study is that galantamine, 16 to 24 mg per day, is superior to placebo in reducing cognitive decline from baseline (start of study drug) as measured by the MMSE over the course of 2 years. The safety hypothesis is that the mortality rate in the galantamine 16 to 24 mg per day treatment group will be the same as that in the placebo group over the course of 2 years.","outpatients; diagnosed with mild to moderately-severe, probable or possible ad, established in accordance with the criteria defined by the national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke and alzheimer's disease related disorders association or the diagnostic and statistical manual, fourth edition; living with or have regular and frequent visits from a responsible caregiver.","neurodegenerative disorders other than ad, such as parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia or huntington's disease; any of specified conditions which may contribute to dementia; any of specified coexisting diseases, including significant cardiovascular disease.",Galantamine; Placebo,Change From Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score; The Number of Deaths Reported in Participants

NCT01362686,Conduct a comparative effectiveness clinical trial of medication treatment for behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in a group of real-world memory care clinics with enhanced access to the Indiana Network for Patient Care.,"The overarching goal of this proposal is to enhance the existing information technology infrastructure in Central Indiana to improve the nation's capacity to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER). Consistent with the instructions in RFA-HS-10-005, the investigators propose to apply these new capacities to a novel CER project evaluating treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a first quartile CER priority. This proposal represents collaboration between the Medical Informatics Program at the Regenstrief Institute, Inc (a world leader in health information technology) and two Indiana University research programs: the Center for Aging Research and the Division of Clinical Pharmacology. These programs have an established track record in research relevant to under-served populations. Thus, this proposal combines considerable investigator, environment, and research strengths to continue to build a novel CER infrastructure in support of the nation's evidentiary CER priorities.

Throughout this proposal, the investigators use the AHRQ definition of CER: the conduct and synthesis of research comparing the benefits and harms of different interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor health conditions in real world settings."" The investigators also refer to a clinical trial of medication treatment for behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease as the specific CER proposed to demonstrate the potential of our new infrastructure. However, the investigators stress that the enhancements proposed to existing infrastructure would support a broad portfolio of CER across an array of priority conditions. The investigators are also proposing enhancements in our privacy and confidentiality technology that would allow researchers from across the country to access de-identified data in support of CER. In summary, the investigators are proposing to add new CER knowledge on Alzheimer' disease and thereby field test new information technology capacities important to a wide range of CER projects while also increasing our capacity to provide data and opportunities for nationwide CER.

The derivation of meaningful and actionable evidence from CER ultimately depends on capturing relevant, comprehensive and accurate data about treatment decisions, patients' clinical status, their care processes and environment, and the health outcomes they experience and value. Such data must be tracked longitudinally in order to determine temporal relationships, cause-effect paradigms, and the efficacy of specific clinical interventions in the context of other conditions, interventions, and goals of care. At Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute, the investigators have four decades of experience and a well-documented, world-class clinical informatics and research infrastructure for capturing, storing, querying and analyzing treatment patterns and patients' clinical outcomes.

The maturation of this health information technology is now embodied within the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a fully-operational regional health information exchange. The investigators are well positioned to expand and leverage this infrastructure in support of local and national multi-site clinical trials in comparative effectiveness. The specific aims of this proposal are to:

1.0 PROSPECT STUDY: Enhance our existing information technology infrastructure to:

1. provide de-identified access to the INPC database for CER work
2. capture, store, and track a broader array of health care outcomes important to patients and their caregivers (e.g. behavioral symptoms due to dementia);
3. support providers' and caregivers' and researchers' increasing need to work in teams by providing new tools for communication and co-management (e.g. collaborative care and research)

NCT01689948,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly patients. By its prevalence and its medical and social consequences, AD represents a dual challenge to public health and society. The elderly want to stay in their homes even when their lives are altered by a chronic progressive disease. Their caregivers claim in turn a support at home. But this desire is questioned because of the characteristics of the disease, e.g. the altered relational function by the cognitive impairment and the behavioural disorders associated.

Outpatients non-drug therapies represent a potential support that adapts to patient with an AD or mixed dementia, especially in their milder forms.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a weekly rehabilitation's intervention at home and its acceptability by both the patient and the caregiver.

The study of its efficiency in terms of autonomy will be the next step.","The protocol is based on weekly rehabilitation's intervention at home. All home visits and assessments of the patient and his caregiver will be made by the rehabilitation's therapist himself.

Twelve weekly interventions at home are planed. The first five are needed to define a realistic and achievable goal of treatment which is accepted by the dyad and the therapist. The following seven interventions will achieve this goal by rehabilitation's intervention (e.g. occupational therapy, psychomotor approach).

The investigators will also collect information from the FDG and Amyvid® PET Scans to determine if there is any correlation between neurocognitive/quality of life scores and changes in amyloid plaque size, number and location.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the 7th leading cause of death in the United States with approximately 5.9 million Americans living with the progressive and debilitating condition. AD predominantly affects older individuals as 86% of AD cases are in individuals 65 years of age and older. Further, approximately $172 billion of health care spending annually can be attributed to costs associated with AD care on top of the 11 million caregivers that provide care in unpaid capacities, such as family members, friends, etc.

In 1975, a cohort of nearly 2,800 people who were 65 years of age and free of dementia provided a basis for an incident study of dementia, as well as for Alzheimer's disease. This cohort was followed for almost 29 years and its sentinel findings included a significantly higher lifetime risk for both Alzheimer's and dementia in women compared to men. The estimated lifetime risk was nearly one in five for women compared to one in ten for men. In addition to the higher lifetime risk in women, expectancy of longer life and the aging of the ""baby boomers"" combined with improved healthcare is expected to increase the number of Americans who will reach 85 years of age or more. It is very clear that as the age increases, so does the incidence of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.

Between 2010 and 2050, it is expected that there will be a 30% increase in the number of individuals greater that 85 years of age. Although the absolute number may not appear to be significant, this increase of approximately 17 million people will challenge the healthcare system because of the cost associated with dealing various acute and chronic medical conditions including AD.

While other major causes of death continue to experience decline, those from AD continues to rise. In 1991, only approximately 14,000 death certificates recorded Alzheimer's disease as an underlying cause. In 2006, it was noted that there was an increase of approximately 46% in which Alzheimer's disease was listed as the direct cause of death. This is significant when compared to the present leading cause of death, heart disease, which decreased by 11% in the same time.

From a neurophysiological standpoint, what is known about Alzheimer's disease is that there appears to be a progressive process that is associated with the deposition of β Amyloid. This appears to have a triggering mechanism, which causes the phosphorylation of a TAU protein, which then leads to development neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are believed to be responsible for memory loss, especially short-term and other associated problems with Alzheimer's related dementia. It also appears that there may be a selective deposition of the β Amyloid in the hippocampus and the prefrontal regions, which are the major short-term memory regions of the brain.

Extensive research has been ongoing to try to find various ways in which the excess deposition of β Amyloid, the removal of excess β Amyloid, the initiation sequence that it is involved in with phosphorylated TAU and other selective processes can be altered in an effort to mitigate the devastating end term results. To date, there have been several trials, including a vaccine trial performed in Europe and in the United States, which seem to show that clearance of the β Amyloid is possible. However, there was not significant improvement in neurocognitive function (NCF), which led to the discontinuation of these trials.

This lack of improvement in NCF was believed to be secondary to the fact that the β Amyloid had already resulted in the phosphorylation of the TAU protein and development of NFT. Thus removal of the initiator was accomplished, but only after the end damage had developed. Then why consider irradiation?

The use of radiation in the treatment of non-oncologic human populations has enjoyed a long history and a more recent renaissance. It is now commonly used to prevent heterotopic bone formation and re-development of keloids or heterotrophic scars post-operatively. It has been shown in a randomized trial to effectively treat planter fasciitis and has been used in post-operative treatment of resected pterygium. It has been used in the treatment of Hidradenitis suppurativa, Duputryen's disease and Ledderhose's disease. These sites routinely are treated with low dose fractionated external beam irradiation, commonly in doses that ranging from 7 to 24 Gy.

The use of external irradiation has also been reported in the treatment of symptomatic systemic amyloidosis. In published peer reviewed articles treatment sites have include trachea-pulmonary, ocular, laryngeal and for use as a conditioning agent for autologous BMT in patients with systemic amyloidosis. These reports used external beam irradiation that ranged from 5.5 - 45 Gy and detail durable local control with these doses.

Because of this effect, a series of basic science experiments were initiated with genetically altered mice: the B6; Cg - Tg 85 Dbo/J over express amyloid and the B6; 129-Psen1tm1MpmTg over express both amyloid and TAU, making them prone to early Alzheimer's disease development.

Both single and fractionated CNS irradiation in a genetically altered mouse model were tested, and have shown similar results with reduction in amyloid plaque number, size and volume. Moreover, the fractionated studies the investigators have demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the treated mice using the Morris Water Maze Test when compared to control non-treated animals, an effect which held up whether the animals were adolescent, mature or aged (up to 18 months old).

The exact mechanism by which radiation therapy confers benefit in the Alzheimer's disease mouse model will be difficult to elucidate as the exact pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease is not known. Possible mechanisms include the following: reduction of β amyloid by reducing production or increasing clearance; reduction in Tau; induction of beneficial inflammatory mechanisms; induction or inhibition of heat shock proteins; altering cerebral microvasculature; and/or reversal of maladaptive neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. Investigations of these possible mechanisms are currently underway.

One of the complications related to studying Alzheimer's disease is the actual diagnosis. Unlike malignancies where a biopsy can be obtained, Alzheimer's disease is a diagnosis of exclusion or made at autopsy. While the Europeans have recently identified and agreed on CSF biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the investigators have not accepted that premise in the United States. At the present time, PET imaging which utilizes various compounds has been utilized to identify depositions of amyloid in the CNS. More recently, there is some suggestive evidence that a specific type of cataract may be seen in a high percentage of patients with Alzheimer's disease related to possible β Amyloid deposition in the lens region (29-30). Many rely on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

While it is a diagnosis of exclusion, there are well-accepted neurocognitive tests (NCT) used to monitor Alzheimer's disease progression. The Mini Mental exam is one of the general NCT used to help establish the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. There are other more sensitive neurocognitive tests available to track progression of Alzheimer's dementia, which the investigators will use in this study. Note estimation of premorbid IQ is only completed at the screening appointment and administration of the BNT and JLO only occur at the baseline pre-treatment visit and the 12-months post-treatment follow up visit to minimize participant fatigue and familiarity with the test materials. Administration of the NCT at the screening visit will serve two purposes. Data obtained from the screening visit will ensure that subjects who are enrolled in the trial meet criteria for early AD based on the more comprehensive battery of tests, as diagnosis of dementia is improved with use of quantitative measurement of multiple domains. The NCT at this screening visit will also expose participants to the NCT and since practice effects are greatest between the first and second exposure to NCT, practice effects will be minimized using this exposure and repeated measures ANOVAs.

Psychological functioning and quality of life (QOL) will also be evaluated to monitor participants' emotional status throughout the trial. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaires will be used to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. If any participant endorses suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9, the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) will be administered to fully evaluate the participant's suicidal ideation and study stopping rules will be implemented as needed to ensure the individual's safety. QOL will be evaluated by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) and Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia (QUALID) and Everyday Cognition (ECog) questionnaires (patient and caregiver forms).

Concern may be raised regarding the use of whole brain irradiation and its potential deleterious effect on neurocognitive testing. There have been reports on post-radiation neurocognitive testing in the setting of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), which is whole brain fractionated RT commonly employed for patients with pulmonary small cell carcinoma. The standard whole brain PCI dose is 2.5 Gy x 10, considerably higher than the 2.0 Gy x 5 or 2.0 Gy x 10 schemes planned in the present study. Furthermore, patients in the PCI studies also received chemotherapy in addition to whole brain irradiation, and chemotherapy itself effects long-term NCF. In these PCI reports, if any neurocognitive decline was identified, it was modest, occurred within a short interval, e.g. 6-9 months, and improved. The investigators are thus proposing a 9-month follow up period for the 1st subject cohort (2.0 Gy x 5) before proceeding with the 2nd cohort (2.0 Gy x 10), although both cohorts will undergo NCF and QOL testing through 12 months.

Grosshans and colleagues from M. D. Anderson found that PCI is ""unlikely to significantly affect NCF."" They evaluated cognitive function in small cell lung cancer patients who received PCI (mean 2.5 Gy x 10). After chemotherapy, but before PCI, 47% already had evidence of impaired cognitive function. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant further declines after PCI. On univariate analysis, there were unsustained, early decreases in executive and language function, which did not persist with follow-up. A Japanese group applied the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (revised Japanese version, HVLT-R) in 40 whole brain RT patients, at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months. Whole brain fractionation was either 2.5 Gy x 4, 3.0 Gy x 10, or 2.5 Gy x 10. The respective probabilities of decline in HVLT-R total recall at 4 months were, respectively, 40%, 7%, and 0%, and at 8 months 13%, 14% and 0% (48).

Also applicable is a recent report of whole brain (and whole spine) RT for medulloblastoma in children, a population believed more vulnerable to cognitive decline from RT. They did not receive chemotherapy, rather RT alone, 36 Gy in 36 fractions (1.0 Gy BID) to the entire brain and spine, followed by a boost to 68 Gy in 68 fractions to the tumor bed, typically posterior fossa. Using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children to give verbal quotient, performance quotient, and full-scale intelligence quotient, cognitive function was preserved for all test domains throughout the study at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years, with no decline over time.

Low dose whole brain RT has demonstrated safety in many studies, and the investigators will be using even lower doses. These lower radiation therapy doses have a history of excellent success for patients with non-cerebral amyloidosis, and have had durable response combined with the necropsy / neurocognitive testing in genetically altered Alzheimer's disease mouse model, the investigators decided to proceed with a human trial, using fractionated whole brain radiation doses of 2.0 Gy x 5, then 2.0 Gy x 10. Subjects will be followed with neurocognitive testing at 6 weeks, 3, 9 and 12 months post RT. Additionally, given that the development of supranuclear cataract has been reported in a high percent of AD patients, the investigators will recommend ocular testing at baseline and at 1 year to assess a potential abscopal effect, collateral benefit to the non-targeted lenses from treatment of the primary disease in the brain.

With respect to the development of cataracts in association with AD, early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a challenge and the confirmatory diagnosis is made by presence of features including beta-amyloid plaques postmortem. In 2014, Tian et al suggested that AD may have a common pathophysiology with supranuclear deposits of beta-amyloid in the human lens. The brain and the lens tissue both arise from the ectoderm tissue (neuroectoderm and surface ectoderm respectively). Their conclusions were based on a meta-analysis of studies, which provided mixed data regarding the correlation of beta-amyloid in the lens samples of patients with AD, Down syndrome and controls. Given the chronicity of the terminally differentiated cell types in the lens that may be affected by Alzheimer disease's pathology, they concluded that there is a possibility than an ocular biomarker for early AD may exist in the lens. This would suggest that an early ophthalmic examination may provide a window of hope into early diagnosis of AD. It may also provide an opportunity for early treatment and perhaps monitoring of improvement in supranuclear cataracts with systemic therapy.

A precedent for this is already found in Wilson's disease. Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) ring seen in Wilson's disease (WD) is due to copper deposition in the Descemet's membrane in the sclero-corneal junction in the eye. Although believed to be pathognomic of WD, it may be seen in many other hepatic conditions and intraocular copper-containing foreign bodies. The K-F ring detected in pre-symptomatic cases of WD may lead to speedy diagnosis and early management. Co-relation of K-F ring in WD to the disease severity, disappearance with successful treatment, reappearance with non-compliant treatment aids in management of WD. K-F ring detection in first-degree relatives of the index case is also important.

With the proposed ocular exams at baseline and at 9-months post treatment, the investigators hope to detect any cataracts in the subjects and effects of the proposed radiation treatments.

NCT02864303,"Although saliva is not generally regarded as one of the most interesting biological fluids, the fact that it can be sampled using simple, noninvasive methods makes it an interesting alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood for diagnostic purposes. The use of salivary diagnostics is moreover increasing these past 10 years, as shown with the abundant literature as well as various clinical trials. Saliva collection which is now well standardized has the major advantage of being simple and non-invasive. An original study had already discussed possible changes in the salivary composition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The feasibility and the potential interest of measuring saliva concentration of the amyloid peptides was reported in an article published recently. The prospect of using saliva for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD is thus of major interest and the objective of the current trial.","Saliva samples

To minimize the circadian effects, saliva specimens were all collected between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. Prior to the sampling procedure, participants rinsed out their mouths three times with water. To induce salivary production, patients were asked to chew neutral or citric acid impregnated Salivette cotton swabs for exactly 60 seconds. Saliva specimens were centrifuged for 2 minutes at a rate of 1000 g to yield clear saliva, which was aliquoted into 500 µL samples in LoBind tubes and stored at -80°C before being analyzed.

Design of the study

Saliva sampling will be performed at V0 (M0), V1 (M12) and V2 (M24). Blood sampling will take place also in V1 (M12). The cases and the controls will be systematically reviewed 12 months after inclusion with a new saliva collection and a cognitive assessment (for cases and controls).

The aim of this study is (beside of safety) to demonstrate the stop of the vascular remodeling and cognition decline by immunoadsorption, a therapeutic method which is well established in cardiology and nephrology.",55-85 years of age; diagnosis of alzheimer's disease; presence of agaab against alpha1-adrenoceptor; mini mental state examination (mmse) score between 19 and 26; written informed consent given,"haemanalysis: ; presence of autoantibodies against the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor ; defective blood coagulation at time of inclusion ; severe protein deficiency disorders ; manifest vitamin/folic acid deficiency (substitution allowed); active infectious disease, or signs of ongoing infection with c-reactive protein (crp) \>10mmol/l; impaired renal function (serum creatinine \>220 μmol/l); any disease requiring immunosuppressive drugs or therapeutic antibodies; non curative treated malignant disease or another life-threatening disease with poor prognosis (survival less than 2 years), except for basal-cell carcinoma; unstable angina pectoris, atrioventricular block (av block) 2./3. degree or symptomatic sick sinus syndrome without implanted pacemaker, history of myocardial infarct, bypass or other revascularization measures, valvular heart defect (≥ 2. degree); severely reduced left ventricular systolic function (lvef \ 60%, peripheral artery occlusive disease (paod) \> iib, nascet, no clinical manifest apparent stroke in anamnesis, mri: no diffusion disorder, no expired territorial stroke; endocrine disorder excluding diabetes mellitus; severe hepatic damages (child-score \< 4); severe mental disorders (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression) requiring treatment; alcohol or drug abuse; drug therapy against dementia since less than 3 months; psychopharmacological drug therapy since less than 3 months; dialysis requirement; mri contraindications (e.g. heart pacemaker); legal tutelage; previous treatments with ia or immunoglobulin; inability to undergo the study procedure (ia on five consecutive days with subsequent immunoglobulin g (igg) substitution); treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ace inhibitors) during the ia (angiotensin receptor blockers (at-blockers) possible); participation in any other clinical/interventional study within less than 30 days prior to screening date",Immunoadsorption with Globaffin,"Changes in cerebral blood flow, estimated by Arterial Spin Labeling MRI"

NCT04010175,"Cerebral functioning changes with age in order to respond to the impacts of different external and internal factors on the brain, and more generally on the human body. Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that during life the brain develops specific neural networks to handle with cognitive activities. When these networks are impaired due to factors that damage brain structure and/or brain functioning, the brain adapts and elaborates new networks to cope with this situation. A cognitive reserve built throughout life and an appropriated care such as for example cognitive training, are in the centre of this model because they are involved in building these networks. In general, studies exploring cognitive training in normal aging and in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease have shown some benefits of the training on cognitive functioning. It has been shown not only that the cognitive training improves older adults' cognition, but also that these effects last for a long time and positively influence older people everyday activities. In fact, the benefits from memory training were observed 5 years after the end of the training and those of reasoning and of speed of processing even after 10 years. In addition, majority of the participants declared to notice improvement of their everyday life. Concerning Alzheimer's disease, several studies have observed positive results of cognitive training although there are some controversies about its' effects. Numerous studies point out that for cognitive training being the most efficient, the intervention has to take place as early as possible, preferentially in a premorbid stage of the disease and that it is important to propose trainings that minimize the withdrawal. In this sense, the importance of using computer based training was put forward because it allows the elaboration of multiple exercises with playful aspect and more importantly it can adapt on line the difficulty of the exercises to the patient's performance. However, if it is commonly admitted that computer based training has an important role in physician's, psychologist's or speech therapist's office less is known about the efficiency of this type of training performed at distance, at the patient's place of residence. It seems probable that to propose distance training as an additional training to that performed in a practitioner's office would increase training benefits. To investigators knowledge this was not investigated in a systematic way with Alzheimer's disease patients. The more important advantages of a such additional training are: (1) reduction of patients' travelling, (2) increased flexibility of training scheduling and (3) increased frequency of training sessions per week.

Thus, in the present study investigators will examine in a systematic way, whether the distance training, as an additional training to this performed in practitioner's office, brings incremental short- and long-term benefits coming from cognitive training in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. Investigators second objective is to determine what would be the best frequency per week of such an additional training.",,60 years old or more; native french speaker; diagnosis of alzheimer's disease according dms-v criteria; early to moderate stage of the disease (mmse \> 15); psychotropic drug treatment without change for three months at least; signed informed consent; being affiliated to a social security,not corrected visual or auditory deficit; motor deficits preventing experimental tests execution; ongoing participation in cognitive training or stimulation for more than three months; not having a computer at the place of residence; refusal of participation; being under guardianship,Control - Cognitive training in a practitioner's office one time per week; Experimental group 1 - Cognitive training in a practitioner's office one time per week and cognitive distance training one time per week; Experimental group 2 - Cognitive training in a practitioner's office one time per week and cognitive distance training four times per week,Influence of the training on experimental tasks; Influence of the training on neuropsychological tests; Influence of the training on global quality of life

Clinic visits will occur 4 weeks after the baseline visit, and then every 12 weeks until the end of the study. The safety of simufilam, and its efficacy in enhancing cognition and slowing cognitive and functional decline will be evaluated.","The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of simufilam (PTI-125) in enhancing cognition and slowing cognitive and functional decline following 76-week, repeat-dose oral administration in participants with mild-to-moderate AD. Secondary objectives are to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms and to replicate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker effects observed in the two Phase 2 studies (PTI-125-03 and PTI-125-02) after 76 weeks of simufilam treatment. A third objective is to investigate the effect of simufilam treatment on plasma biomarkers as well as anatomical correlates of disease progression (brain volume \[hippocampus, ventricles and whole brain\]; and amyloid and tau deposition in the brain). A limited number of research sites will be invited to participate in sub-studies to assess the impact of simufilam on anatomical and biomarker endpoints, including: change from Baseline in CSF biomarkers (30 subjects/group); brain volume via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (50 subjects/group); and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) (40 and 50 subjects/group, respectively). Participants in both PET sub-studies will be required to have an MRI during the Screening Period and provide plasma for a biomarker sub-study. Participants in the tau PET sub-study will also provide additional plasma for a pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure response analysis. Changes from baseline for these imaging and fluid biomarkers represent additional secondary endpoints. The 90 subjects (30 per group) in the CSF sub-study will undergo lumbar puncture during the Screening Period and again at the Week 76 End-of-Treatment Visit to collect CSF biomarkers.

Safety will be evaluated by adverse event monitoring, vital signs, clinical labs, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale at every visit. Subjects will undergo MRI during screening to ensure entry criteria are met (unless recent MRI confirms entry criteria); however, 150 subjects (50 subjects per treatment group) will also undergo repeat MRI assessments at Weeks 40 and 76 to assess both long-term safety and drug impact on brain volume as noted above.

The double-blind arm of DIAN-TU-001 Master protocol (NCT01760005) tested whether gantenerumab provided a clinical benefit by slowing the onset or the worsening of the disease. A clinical benefit was not observed in the double-blind part of the DIAN-TU-001 study. However, gantenerumab was associated with improvements in measures of amyloid and tau and an improvement in an overall measure of neurodegeneration (when nerve cells in the brain lose function over time). It is not known whether these changes may provide future clinical benefits. Based on this information, an exploratory Open Label Extension (OLE) will further study the effect of gantenerumab on these Alzheimer-related proteins and their relationship to disease progression.

After this final evaluation of study treatment with gantenerumab used in the gantenerumab / solanezumab double-blind arm of the Master protocol (NCT01760005), eligible participants from the placebo, solanezumab, and gantenerumab treatment groups in double-blind period were invited to participate in an OLE period to receive active gantenerumab study treatment as part of the DIAN-TU-001 Master protocol. The OLE period of the study planned to provide study treatment with gantenerumab for up to 3 years (36 months).

This study collected brain scans, blood, and spinal fluid tests (also called biomarkers), as well as safety, clinical and cognitive testing. The goal is to determine if gantenerumab has favorable effects on these tests to determine if and how much treatment may prevent or delay the symptoms of AD.

Update:

Based on the results of the completed studies of gantenerumab in sporadic AD in late 2022, it was decided to determine if dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) participants in the DIAN-TU-001 OLE study were substantially clinically benefiting from gantenerumab high-dose treatment before the trial reached completion as the Gant program was being stopped.

An interim efficacy analysis of the DIAN-TU-001 OLE was performed to:

1. determine if gantenerumab OLE treatment and/or long-term treatment results in clinical benefit and determine the extent of amyloid removal compared to the double-blind period.
2. determine the potential effects of gantenerumab on clinical and cognitive measures to support decision-making regarding next steps for the DIAN-TU-001 OLE.","between 18-80 years of age; individuals who know they have an alzheimer's disease-causing mutation; individuals who have participated in the double-blind period; in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, treatment is not contraindicated for safety; capable of receiving drug and appropriate clinical safety assessment; able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (mri), lumbar puncture (lp), positron emission tomography (pet), and complete all study related testing and evaluations.; for women of childbearing potential, if partner is not sterilized, subject must agree to use effective contraceptive measures (hormonal contraception, intra-uterine device, sexual abstinence, barrier method with spermicide).; adequate visual and auditory abilities to perform all aspects of the cognitive and functional assessments.; has a study partner who in the investigator's judgment is able to provide accurate information as to the subject's cognitive and functional abilities, who agrees to provide information at the study visits which require informant input for scale completion.","history or presence of brain mri scans indicative of any other significant abnormality; alcohol or drug dependence currently or within the past 1 year; presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, or foreign metal objects in the eyes, skin or body which would preclude mri scan.; history or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular disease, hepatic/renal disorders, infectious disease or immune disorder, or metabolic/endocrine disorders; anticoagulants except low dose (≤ 325 mg) aspirin.; have been exposed to a monoclonal antibody targeting beta amyloid peptide within the past six months.; history of cancer within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma, non-squamous skin carcinoma, prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ with no significant progression over the past 2 years.; positive urine or serum pregnancy test or plans or desires to become pregnant during the course of the trial.; subjects unable to complete all study related testing, including implanted metal that cannot be removed for mri scanning, required anticoagulation and pregnancy.",Gantenerumab,"Change From Baseline in Composite [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Composite Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (C-SUVR) at Weeks 52, 104 and 156"
