The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined for Crenezumab and Placebo groups. The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels at baseline relative to the total number of participants with a sample available at baseline. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was determined as the proportion of participants with confirmed post-baseline positive ADAs relative to the total number of participants that had at least one post-baseline sample available for ADA analysis.","populationDescription":"Please note that for this Outcome Measure, no Participants were evaluated at all as the existing immunogenicity data from a parent study (Study BN29552) showed a low potential of Crenezumab to induce Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs).","reportingStatus":"POSTED","timeFrame":"Baseline up to end of study (up to 54 weeks).","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Parent Placebo","description":"Participants (who were treated with Placebo in the BN29552/BN29553 Studies) received intravenous (IV) infusion of Crenezumab every 4 weeks (Q4W)."},{"id":"OG001","title":"Parent Crenezumab","description":"Participants (who were treated with Crenezumab in the BN29552/BN29553 Studies) received intravenous (IV) infusion of Crenezumab every 4 weeks (Q4W)."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0"}]}]}]},"adverseEventsModule":{"frequencyThreshold":"5","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to 54 weeks).","eventGroups":[{"id":"EG000","title":"Parent Placebo","description":"Participants (who were treated with Placebo in the BN29552/BN29553 Studies) received intravenous (IV) infusion of Crenezumab every 4 weeks (Q4W).","deathsNumAffected":0,"deathsNumAtRisk":76,"seriousNumAffected":3,"seriousNumAtRisk":76,"otherNumAffected":4,"otherNumAtRisk":76},{"id":"EG001","title":"Parent Crenezumab","description":"Participants (who were treated with Crenezumab in the BN29552/BN29553 Studies) received intravenous (IV) infusion of Crenezumab every 4 weeks (Q4W).","deathsNumAffected":0,"deathsNumAtRisk":73,"seriousNumAffected":4,"seriousNumAtRisk":73,"otherNumAffected":4,"otherNumAtRisk":73}],"seriousEvents":[{"term":"OPTIC ISCHAEMIC NEUROPATHY","organSystem":"Eye disorders","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":73}]},{"term":"INCARCERATED INGUINAL HERNIA","organSystem":"Gastrointestinal disorders","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":73}]},{"term":"RECTAL HAEMORRHAGE","organSystem":"Gastrointestinal disorders","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":73}]},{"term":"PNEUMONIA","organSystem":"Infections and infestations","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":73}]},{"term":"UROSEPSIS","organSystem":"Infections and infestations","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":73}]},{"term":"FALL","organSystem":"Injury, poisoning and procedural complications","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":73}]},{"term":"CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT","organSystem":"Nervous system disorders","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":1,"numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":0,"numAffected":0,"numAtRisk":73}]}],"otherEvents":[{"term":"FALL","organSystem":"Injury, poisoning and procedural complications","sourceVocabulary":"MedDRA 22.0","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numEvents":5,"numAffected":4,"numAtRisk":76},{"groupId":"EG001","numEvents":4,"numAffected":4,"numAtRisk":73}]}]},"moreInfoModule":{"limitationsAndCaveats":{"description":"This study was discontinued due to an interim analysis in the BN29552 study, which indicated that Crenezumab was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint."},"certainAgreement":{"piSponsorEmployee":false,"restrictionType":"OTHER","restrictiveAgreement":true,"otherDetails":"The Study being conducted under this Agreement is part of the Overall Study.
