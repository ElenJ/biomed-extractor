Must have a care partner who, in the investigator's judgment, has frequent and sufficient contact with the participant as to be able to provide accurate information about the participant's cognitive and functional abilities. The care partner must be literate and provide informed consent.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any medical or neurological/neurodegenerative condition (other than AD) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might be a contributing cause to the participant's cognitive impairment (e.g., current history of substance abuse, uncontrolled vitamin B12 deficiency or abnormal thyroid function, stroke or other cerebrovascular condition, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson's Disease, Lewy body dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, frontotemporal dementia) or could lead to discontinuation, lack of compliance, interference with study assessments, or safety concerns.\n2. Non-amnestic presentation of AD as judged by the investigator.\n3. Woman of childbearing potential.\n4. Any prior or ongoing exposure to active or passive anti-amyloid immunotherapy, anti-tau immunotherapy, an anti-tau antisense oligonucleotide or gene therapy, or O-linked-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) inhibitor.\n\nOther protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria could apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"K2 Medical Research","city":"Clermont","state":"Florida","zip":"34711","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":28.54944,"lon":-81.77285}},{"facility":"K2 Medical Research - The Villages","city":"Lady Lake","state":"Florida","zip":"32159","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":28.91749,"lon":-81.92286}},{"facility":"K2 Medical Research","city":"Maitland","state":"Florida","zip":"32751","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":28.62778,"lon":-81.36312}},{"facility":"Alzheimer's Treatment and Research Center","city":"Stuart","state":"Florida","zip":"34997","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":27.19755,"lon":-80.25283}},{"facility":"Alzheimer's Treatment and Research Center","city":"Wellington","state":"Florida","zip":"33414","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":26.65868,"lon":-80.24144}},{"facility":"Columbus Memory Center, LLC","city":"Columbus","state":"Georgia","zip":"31909","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.46098,"lon":-84.98771}},{"facility":"Re:Cognition Health","city":"Fairfax","state":"Virginia","zip":"22031","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.84622,"lon":-77.30637}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"resultsSection":{"participantFlowModule":{"recruitmentDetails":"A total of 123 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were enrolled in the study.
