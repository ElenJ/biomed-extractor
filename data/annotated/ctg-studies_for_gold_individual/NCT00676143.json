Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension.\n\nThis scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced.\n\nThe ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment.

Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100.

PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging.
