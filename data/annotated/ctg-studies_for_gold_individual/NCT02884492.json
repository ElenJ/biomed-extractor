A type of PET scan is used to measure the abnormal accumulation of protein called tau in the brain. These are thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. The investigators will also perform brain MRI and to tests to measure the participant's memory and thinking.","detailedDescription":"This study is being done to determine the relationship between tau tangles and cognitive impairment in elderly subjects with different clinical and biomarker profiles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects will undergo screen that includes neuropsychological testing and brain MRI. This study uses a special type of scan called a PET scan to take pictures of the brain. During the PET scan, a special radioactive dye called 18F-THK-5351 is injected into the body. 18F-THK-5351 sticks to abnormal tangles made of the protein tau. Subjects will have the option to have lumbar puncture performed to measure CSF concentrations of biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alzheimer's Disease"],"keywords":["inflammation","aging","mild cognitive impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cognitive impairment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Adults with Alzheimer's disease, preclinical Alzheimer's disease or impairment due to suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology will receive 18F-THK- 5351 and/or lumbar puncture (optional).","interventionNames":["Drug: 18F-THK-5351","Procedure: Lumbar Puncture (optional)"]},{"label":"No cognitive impairment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Normal aging adults will receive 18F-THK- 5351 and/or lumbar puncture (optional).","interventionNames":["Drug: 18F-THK-5351","Procedure: Lumbar Puncture (optional)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"18F-THK-5351","description":"18F-THK-5351 is a PET radioligand that binds abnormal tangles made of the protein tau.
