Participants were enrolled into Cohort I (CAD106) or Cohort II (CNP520).\n\nThe planned treatment period of 5 to 8 years was not achieved due to early study termination.\n\nThe study was terminated due to unexpected changes in cognitive function, brain volume loss, and body weight loss. Cohort II (CNP520) treatment was stopped and evaluated through an off-treatment follow-up period. After the decision to terminate Cohort II of the study (CNP520), treatment with CAD106 (Cohort I) was also terminated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alzheimers Disease"],"keywords":["Randomization","Placebo controlled","Parallel-group","APOE4 Homozygotes","Preclinical Alzheimers Disease (AD)","Aβ lowering","CNP520","CAD106","elderly","Brain Amyloid","BACE-1 inhibitor","Prevention","Unimpaired cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":480,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort I (CAD106)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CAD106 (450 µg) + Alum (450 µg) intra-muscular injection at Weeks 1, 7, 13 and every 13 weeks thereafter","interventionNames":["Biological: CAD106 Immunotherapy","Other: Alum"]},{"label":"Cohort I (CAD106 Placebo)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo to CAD106 + Alum (450 µg) intra-muscular injection at Weeks 1, 7, 13 and every 13 weeks thereafter","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo to CAD106","Other: Alum"]},{"label":"Cohort II (CNP520)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CNP520 (50 mg) capsules taken orally once daily","interventionNames":["Drug: CNP520"]},{"label":"Cohort II (CNP520 Placebo)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Matching Placebo to CNP520 capsules taken orally once daily","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo to CNP520"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"CAD106 Immunotherapy","description":"Participants will be given i.m. injections at Weeks 1, 7, 13 and quarterly i.m. injections (every 13 weeks) thereafter, until the last injection 3 month prior to completion of the Treatment Epoch.","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (CAD106)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo to CAD106","description":"Participants will be given i.m. injections at Weeks 1, 7, 13 and quarterly i.m. injections (every 13 weeks) thereafter, until the last injection 3 month prior to completion of the Treatment Epoch.","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (CAD106 Placebo)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"CNP520","description":"CNP520 50 mg capsule p.o. for the duration of the Treatment Epoch.","armGroupLabels":["Cohort II (CNP520)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo to CNP520","description":"Placebo to CNP520 p.o. for the duration of the Treatment Epoch","armGroupLabels":["Cohort II (CNP520 Placebo)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Alum","description":"Alum was mixed with reconstituted CAD106 as adjuvant therapy to maximize the effectiveness of CAD106","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (CAD106 Placebo)","Cohort I (CAD106)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to Event (Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia, Due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD))","description":"Event was defined as the first confirmed diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia due to AD (whichever occurred first) after adjudication by the progression adjudication committee (PAC) as triggered either by an investigator diagnosis or an increase in the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score.
