The planned number of participants for this study is approximately 1200 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either gantenerumab or placebo (600 participants randomized to gantenerumab and 600 participants randomized to placebo).",YES,Alzheimers Disease,DRUG: Gantenerumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in PACC-5 Score, The PACC-5 is computed as the average of z-scores of the following cognitive measures: 1. Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS LM I-II) - Total Score LM II Delayed Recall; 2. Free \& Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) -Immediate and Delayed Recall - Trials 1-3: Total Recall; 3. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - IV Coding - Total Raw Score; 4. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) - Total Score; 5. Category Fluency Test (CFT) - 3 categories - Vegetables, Fruits and Animals - Total Admissible Words. The z-score was defined as the difference between the assessment and the mean of baseline assessments, divided by the standard deviation of baseline assessments. Z-scores range from -3 to +3 with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)","Time From Randomization to Clinical Progression to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Dementia Due to AD, Time from randomization to clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease was based on the diagnosis of the independent Clinical Adjudication Committee (iCAC)., Randomization to early termination Visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Time to Onset of Confirmed Clinical Progression, Time to onset of confirmed clinical progression was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of two consecutive visits (approximately 6 months apart) with a Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR-GS) of \> 0. CDR is a clinician reported (ClinRO) measure used to stage severity of AD dementia based on a semi-structured interview with participant \& a reliable informant. CDR characterizes participant's level of cognitive \& functional impairment across six domains (memory, orientation, judgment \& problem solving, community affairs, home \& hobbies, \& personal care) on a 5-point rating. CDR-GS is calculated based on the Washington University CDR-assignment algorithm \& characterizes a participant's level of global impairment/stage of dementia according to following categories: 0 (normal), 0.5 (very mild dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), \& 3 (severe dementia). Score ranges from 0 to 3 \& a high score on CDR-GS would indicate a high disease severity., Randomization to early termination Visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire Short Version (A-IADL-Q-SV), A-IADL-Q-SV=observer reported (ObsRO) measure assessing participant's ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (including household/leisure activities, use of household appliances, management of finances, etc.). A-IADL-Q-SV includes 30 items rated by study partner. Each item is divided into 2 questions=1st question asks if activity was performed by participant during past 4 weeks (Yes/No/Don't know). If performed, 2nd question captures level of difficulty while performing activity on 5-point Likert scale (no difficulty to no longer able to perform the activity). If not performed, 2nd question captures why activity was not performed (never done before, no longer able to do so due to physical problems, no longer able to do so due to difficulties with memory/planning/thinking/other, including free text response). A-IADL-Q-SV=average of all scored responses multiplied by 25. Score range=0-100. Higher scores=better functioning. Negative change from baseline=worsening., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the Cognitive Function Instrument Acute (CFIa) Participant Version, The CFIa is an outcome measure developed to assess memory-related cognitive and functional decline in non-demented elderly individuals. The CFIa is a modified version of the original CFI and differs in terms of recall period and item response options. The CFIa is computed as the sum of 14 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Never=0 to Always=4 and referring to the participant's current ability (most recent experience). Total scores range from 0 to 56. Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement. The participant (PRO) and study partner (ObsRO) versions of the CFIa were used in this study., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the CFIa Study Partner Version, The CFIa is an outcome measure developed to assess memory-related cognitive and functional decline in non-demented elderly individuals.

The PRO and ObsRO versions of the CFIa were used in this study., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), The CDR is a ClinRO measure used to stage the severity of AD dementia based on a semi-structured interview with the participant and a reliable informant. The CDR characterizes the participant's level of cognitive and functional impairment across six domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care) on a 5-point rating scale in which 0 = None, 0.5 = questionable, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe (with the exception of personal care, which is rated on a 4-point rating scale and excludes the questionable impairment level). The CDR-SB is calculated by summing the ratings across each of the six domains (total score: 0 to 18), with higher scores indicating greater impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Baseline to early termination visit (up to 225 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability or incapacity, and leads to congenital anomaly or birth defect. An AESI included drug induced liver injury and suspected transmission of infectious agent via medicinal products., Day 1 to safety follow-up visit (up to 310 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Gantenerumab, The number of ADA-positive participants after drug administration were determined for participants exposed to gantenerumab. For determining post-baseline incidence, participants were considered to be ADA-positive if they were ADA-negative or had missing data at baseline but developed an ADA response following study drug exposure, or if they were ADA-positive at baseline and the titer of 1 or more post-baseline samples was at least 4-fold higher in comparison to the titer at the baseline. As prespecified in the protocol, this outcome measure was applicable only to participants exposed to gantenerumab., Day 1 to early termination visit (up to 216 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Findings: Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities - Edema/Effusion (ARIA-E) and ARIA-Hemosiderin Deposition (ARIA-H), ARIA are an identified risk with anti-amyloid antibodies, including gantenerumab. These changes can be identified on brain MRI. In ARIA-E, (E for edema or effusion), edema can be seen in different areas of the brain on MRI, representing fluid leakage into the brain parenchyma or sulcal spaces. ARIA-H (H for hemosiderosis) are small foci of signal loss observed on MRI sequences sensitive for paramagnetic tissue properties and comprise cerebral microbleeds (small foci of bleeding in the brain parenchyma) and leptomeningeal hemosiderosis (small foci of bleeding on the surface of the brain). These changes also occur sporadically in AD., Day 1 to early termination visit (up to 248 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Injection-site Reactions (ISRs), An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. Local injection reactions (or injection-site reactions) are defined as AEs related to the injection site that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration that are judged to be related to the study drug injection., Day 1 to safety follow-up visit (up to 310 days from start of treatment)|Number of Participants With Post-baseline Suicidal Behaviors and Ideations as Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score, The C-SSRS is an assessment tool used to assess the lifetime suicidality of a participant (baseline) as well as any new instances of suicidality (since last visit). The structured interview prompts recollection of suicidal ideation (SI), including the intensity of the ideation, behavior, \& attempts with actual or potential lethality. Categories have binary responses (yes/no) \& include: Wish to be Dead; Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts; Active SI with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act; Active SI with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan; Active SI with Specific Plan \& Intent, Preparatory Acts \& Behavior; Aborted Attempt; Interrupted Attempt; Actual Attempt (non-fatal); Completed Suicide. SI or behavior is indicated by a ""yes"" answer to any of the listed categories. A score of 0 is assigned if no suicide risk is present. A score of 1 or higher indicates SI or behavior. Only categories with at least one participant with event are reported., Day 1 to safety follow-up visit (up to 310 days from start of treatment)|Change in Brain Amyloid Load Over Time as Measured by Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in a Subset of Participants, Brain amyloid load over time was planned to be assessed using \[18F\] florbetaben or \[18F\] flutemetamol tracers. These are PET radioligand selective to amyloid. Amyloid PET burden is measured in a composite region of interest (ROI) by using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) mapped to the centiloid scale. The weighted composite target region are composed of (both left and right side): frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe lateral, cingulum posterior and anterior cingulate gyrus. The reference region used to normalize the composite region is the whole cerebellum. The centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan., Baseline|Change in Brain Tau Load Over Time as Measured by Tau PET in a Subset of Participants, Change in tau load represents how much neurofibrillary tau pathology is present in brain assessed using PET scan. For the longitudinal tau PET assessment, \[18F\]-MK-6240 was used. Tau load is measured using SUVR in four composite target ROIs: Temporal composite target region included (both left \& right) anterior \& posterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior temporal lobe, fusiform gyrus, \& middle and inferior temporal gyrus; Medial temporal composite region not including hippocampus included (both left \& right): amygdala, parahippocampus \& anterior medial \& lateral temporal lobe; Frontal lobe (both left \& right) \& Parietal lobe (both left \& right).

NCT00676143,Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Bapineuzumab in Alzheimer Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00676143,,TERMINATED,This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease. Patients will receive either bapineuzumab or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 1.5 years.,YES,Alzheimer Disease,DRUG: bapineuzumab|DRUG: placebo,"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)/11 Subscale Total Score at Week 78, The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension.

This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced.

The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment., Baseline and 78 weeks|Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Total Score at Week 78, The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant.

This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement., Baseline and 78 weeks","Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71, Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semi-quantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants., Baseline and 71 weeks|Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Phospho-tau Levels at Week 71, Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab., Baseline and 71 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume, as Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI), at Week 71, Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment., Baseline and 71 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the ADAS-Cog/11 Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, Treatment differences are estimated using least-squares (LS) means with factor levels weighted according to overall analysis population proportions. ADAS-Cog/11 total score range is 0 (least impairment) to 70 (most impairment); a negative treatment difference (bapineuzumab minus placebo) favors bapineuzumab. Within the MMRMs for ADAS-Cog/11 described for the primary analyses, linear contrasts were formed to test increasing trend of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo from Week 39 (the 9-month visit) through Week 78 (the 18 -month visit) for each variable, which is equivalent to testing a positive slope of the differences between each bapineuzumab dose group and placebo from Week 39 through Week 78. Results are from a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for MMRM., Week 39 to Week 78|Divergence of Effect on the DAD Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, Treatment differences are estimated using least-squares (LS) means with factor levels weighted according to overall analysis population proportions. DAD total score range is 0 to 100; a positive treatment difference (bapineuzumab minus placebo) favors bapineuzumab. Within the MMRMs for ADAS-Cog/11 described for the primary analyses, linear contrasts were formed to test increasing trend of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo from Week 39 (the 9-month visit) through Week 78 (the 18 -month visit) for each variable, which is equivalent to testing a positive slope of the differences between each bapineuzumab dose group and placebo from Week 39 through Week 78.

The DS total score ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating more need for assistance. The DS was administered as an interview to the caregiver at scheduled study visits., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (EU Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants with worsening from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score of ≤0, ≤3, and ≤7 points were reported. In order to calculate time to first median placebo deterioration in ADAS-Cog/11, the median change from baseline to Week 78 among the placebo participants of the mITT analysis population were determined. The median changes were used as the cutpoints for determining ""deterioration"" for Alzheimer's disease participants in the study. If the median change from baseline to Week 78 in the ADAS-Cog/11 total score among the placebo participants of the mITT Analysis Population is 7 points, then the first median placebo deterioration is the first time where there is a worsening on the ADAS-Cog/11 total score of 7 points or more and the worsening is confirmed by the ADAS-Cog/11 assessment at the next non-missing visit., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Responders for ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose increase (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score was \<7., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in DAD Total Score at Week 78 (EU Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score of ≤ 0, ≤ 6, and ≤ 12 points. In order to calculate time to first median placebo deterioration in DAD, the median change from baseline to Week 78 among the placebo participants of the mITT analysis population were determined. The median changes were used as the cutpoints for determining ""deterioration"" for Alzheimer's disease participants in the study. If the median change from baseline to Week 78 in the DAD total score among the placebo participants of the mITT Analysis Population is 7 points, then the first median placebo deterioration is the first time where there is a worsening on the DAD total score of 7 points or more and the worsening is confirmed by the DAD assessment at the next non-missing visit., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Percentage of Responders for DAD Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score was \<12., Baseline and 78 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 78, The CDR-SOB is a global clinical staging instrument that sums 6 clinical ratings: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) interview. The CDR includes discussions with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant.

NCT00667810,Study Evaluating The Efficacy And Safety Of Bapineuzumab In Alzheimer Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00667810,,TERMINATED,This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease. Patients will receive either bapineuzumab or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 1.5 years.,YES,Alzheimer Disease,DRUG: bapineuzumab|DRUG: bapineuzumab|DRUG: placebo,"The Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)/11 Total Score at Week 78, The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment., 78 weeks|The Change From Baseline in the Disability Assessment for Demential (DAD) Total Score at Week 78, The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement., 78 weeks","The Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71., Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semiquantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants., 71 Weeks|The Change From Baseline in Phospho-tau Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) at Week 71., Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau (p-tau) is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab., 71 Weeks|The Change From Baseline in Brain Volume at Week 71, Brain volume was examined in a subset of participants by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI). Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment., 71 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the ADAS-Cog/11 Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, The MMRM estimated slope (based on linear contrasts) of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo for the ADAS-Cog/11 total scores from Week 39 to Week 78 was presented., 39 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the DAD Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, The MMRM estimated slope (based on linear contrasts)of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo for the DAD total scores from Week 39 to Week 78 was presented., 39 weeks|Time to Median Placebo Deterioration on ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score (European Union [EU] Analysis Plan), The time to first median placebo deterioration (for the EU) was defined as the first time a subject experienced an increase from baseline (worsening) in ADAS Cog/11 total score greater than or equal to the median worsening observed at Week 78 in the placebo group. The Kaplan Meier estimate of the median time to first median placebo deterioration in ADAS Cog/11 total score was presented., 78 Weeks|Time to First Clinically Meaningful Deterioration on ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score (United States [US] Analysis Plan), The time to first clinically meaningful deterioration (for the US) was defined as the first time a participant experienced an increase (worsening) from baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 total score of \>=7., 78 weeks|Time to Median Placebo Deterioration on DAD Total Score, The time to first median placebo deterioration (for the EU) was defined as the first time a participant experienced a decrease (worsening) in DAD total score greater than or equal to the median worsening at Week 78 in the placebo group., 78 Weeks|Time to First Clinically Meaningful Deterioration on DAD Total Score (US Analysis Plan), The time to first clinically meaningful deterioration was defined as the first time a participant experienced a decrease (worsening)from baseline in DAD total score of \>=12., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (European Union Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose increase (worsening) in ADAS-Cog/11 total score from baseline to Week 78 was at most 0, 3, 7 points., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose increase (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in ADAS-Cog/11 total score is \<7., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in DAD Total Score at Week 78 (European Union Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score was at most 0, 6, 12 points., 78 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Worsening From Baseline in DAD Total Score at Week 78 (US Analysis Plan), Percentage of participants whose decrease (worsening) from baseline to Week 78 in DAD total score was \<12., 78 weeks|Change From Baseline in Dependence Scale Total Score at Week 78, The Dependence Scale (DS) is a 13-item, caregiver-rated instrument for determining the amount of support required by a participant with AD. The DS total score ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating more need for assistance. The DS was administered as an interview to the caregiver at scheduled study visits., 78 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 78, The CDR-SOB is a global clinical staging instrument that sums 6 clinical ratings: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) interview. The CDR includes discussions with the participant and caregiver using a structured format.

The total score of the 13-item scale ranges from 0 to 85, with an increase in score indicating cognitive worsening. Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline ADAS-Cog13 total score, age at baseline, and baseline ADAS-Cog13 total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78","Change From Baseline in Alzheimer´s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Instrumental Items Score (ADCS-iADL), The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline iADL score, age at baseline, and baseline iADL score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Score, FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-based questionnaire and was administered to the study partner who was asked to rate the participant's ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from writing checks, assembling tax records, shopping, playing games, food preparation, traveling, keeping appointments, traveling out of neighborhood, keeping track of current events and understanding media. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. Each activity is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (Never did and would have difficulty now=1; never did \[the activity\] but could do now=0; normal=0; has difficulty but does by self=1; requires assistance=2; Dependent =3). FAQ scale is 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean determined by MMRM model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline FAQ total score, by-visit interaction and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score, The iADRS is a composite that measures both cognition and function. The iADRS comprises scores form the ADAS- Cog and the ADCS-iADL. The iADRS is calculated as a linear combination of the total scores of the ADAS-Cog13 (score range 0 to 85 with higher scores reflecting worse performance) and the ADCS-iADL (score range from 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance). The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline iADRS13 total score, age at baseline, and baseline iADRS13 total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, The CDR-SB is a rater administered scale and impairment is scored in each of categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment is scored on a scale in which no dementia = 0, questionable dementia = 0.5, mild dementia = 1, moderate dementia = 2 and severe dementia = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or ""box scores"", were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline CDR-SB score, age at baseline, and baseline CDR-SB score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Time to Progression as Measured by Loss of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Global Score Stage, The CDR global score is a composite score calculated using the Washington University CDR-assignment algorithm applied to the 6 individual domain box scores (Morris 1993). The memory domain is considered the primary category that drives the CDR global outcome, and all other domains are secondary. The CDR global score ranges from 0 to 3 (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia)., From Loss of 1 Global Stage through Week 78|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline NPI score, age at baseline, and baseline NPI score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's global cognitive function. The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall of words, attention and calculation, language (naming, comprehension and repetition), and spatial ability (copying a figure). The range for MMSE total Score is 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline MMSE total score, age at baseline, and baseline MMSE total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Percent Change From Baseline in Concentration of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarker Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-42, Concentration of the peptide Aβ 1-42 in plasma measured by validated immunoassay.

LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Amyloid deposition in the brain is one of the defining neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by florbetapir amyloid PET imaging in a subset of participants. The Centiloid scale standardizes quantitative brain amyloid PET results to allow cross-tracer and cross-methodology comparisons. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans. Florbetapir SUVr was converted to the Centiloid scale using the following conversion: Florbetapir Centiloids = 183 x SUVr - 177. LS Mean was determined by using ANCOVA methodology with terms for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) Using Florbetapir Perfusion Scan, Florbetapir perfusion evaluated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a biomarker of brain function and was performed at the same time as the amyloid florbetapir PET. Cerebral perfusion, especially in temporal and parietal areas, is reduced in AD and this pattern of hypoperfusion closely mirrors the hypometabolism pattern observed using FDG PET. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF (last observation carried forward) and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Whole Brain Volume, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the effect of lanabecestat on brain atrophy/whole brain volumes.

ADAS-Cog11 is a structured scale that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and constructional praxis. ADAS-Cog11 measures cognition by assessing 11 metrics impaired in AD: word recall; commands; constructional praxis; naming objects and fingers; ideational praxis; orientation; word recognition; remembering test instructions; spoken language ability; word-finding difficulty; and comprehension of spoken language. The total possible score ranges from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Negative values indicate improvement relative to baseline, and vice versa., Baseline and Week 12|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.

ADCS-CGIC is a global scale assessing cognition and function based on structured interviews of both the participant and study partner. ADCS-CGIC focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of the study. Improvement in the ADCS-CGIC overall score, with a score of 1, 2, or 3 indicates improvement. The ADCS-CGIC is a clinician-rated measure of global severity at baseline scored from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients); and global change at follow-up scored from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening), where 4 indicates no change., Week 12|Mean Change From Baseline in The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Total Score at Week 12, The change from baseline in ADCS-ADL score is presented.

An optional 96-week open-label extension period was available to participants who completed the double-blind treatment period and who, in the judgment of the investigator, would potentially benefit from open-label Semorinemab treatment.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Semorinemab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: [18F]GTP1,"Change From Baseline on the CDR-SB, The Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment = 0, questionable impairment = 0.5 and mild, moderate and severe impairment = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The score range is from 0 to 18 with a high score indicating a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 73 between Semorinemab doses and Placebo treated participants was estimated.

The RBANS consists of ten subtests that are combined to provide five indices, one for each of the five domains tested (immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, and delayed memory). Scores range from 40 to 160 and a higher score indicates better cognitive functioning. A decrease in the outcome measure from baseline corresponds to disease worsening. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 73 between Semorinemab doses and Placebo treated participants was estimated., Baseline and 73 weeks|Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog-13) Subscale Score, The ADAS-Cog-13 assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and spontaneous speech. Most of these are assessed by tests although some are rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale. The ADAS-Cog-13 is the ADAS-Cog-11 with 2 further items: delayed word recall and total digit cancellation. The score range for ADAS-Cog-13 is from 0 to 85 with high scores representing severe dysfunction. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 73 between Semorinemab doses and Placebo treated participants was estimated., Baseline and 73 weeks|Change From Baseline on the Amsterdam Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (iADL) Questionnaire, The Amsterdam iADL questionnaire is an informant-based instrument for measuring iADL problems in participants with dementia. This instrument consists of 70 items, scored on a 5-point scale, that uses item response theory for scoring. Items presented to the informant are tailored to responses to earlier items; thus each administration of the Amsterdam iADL may consist of less than the total of 70 items. The resulting score ranges from 20 to 80 with lower scores indicating poorer performance. A decrease in the outcome measure from baseline corresponds to disease worsening.

The ADCS-ADL covers both basic ADL (e.g., eating and toileting) and more complex 'instrumental' ADL or iADL (e.g., using the telephone, managing finances and preparing a meal). The ADCS-ADL consists of 23 questions with a score range of 0 to 78 where a higher score represents better function.

LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-based questionnaire and was administered to the study partner who was asked to rate the participant's ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from financial management, shopping, playing games, food preparation, traveling, keeping appointments, keeping track of current events, and understanding media. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. FAQ Total Score is the sum of 10 items, ranging from 0 (best possible outcome) to 100 (worst possible outcome). LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), NPI assesses psychopathology in participants with dementia and other neurologic disorders. Information is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the participant's behavior. Total score ranges from 12 to 144; Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite (RUD-Lite), Assesses healthcare resource utilization (formal and informal care). Information gathered on both caregivers (care-giving time, work status) and participants (accommodation and healthcare resource utilization) was gathered from baseline and follow-up interviews. Reported number of hospitalizations per participant up to 76 weeks. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD), Assesses QoL for AD: participant rates mood, relationships, memory, finances, physical condition, and overall QoL assessment. Each of 13 items, rated on a 4-point scale. Sum of items=total score (range: 13 to 52). Higher scores indicate greater QoL. Participant's primary caregiver asked to complete same measure. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in 5-Dimensional EuroQol Quality of Life Scale Proxy Version (EQ-5D Proxy), EQ-5D (proxy version) measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. 3 severity levels: no, some, severe problems. Visual analog scale (VAS) assesses caregiver's impression of participant's health state; score ranges: 0 to 100 millimeter (mm). Lower scores=greater disease severity LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Change From Baseline in Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale is used to assess that solanezumab slows down the cognitive and functional decline associated with AD compared with placebo. iADRS is a simple linear combination of ADAS-Cog 13 or 14 and the ADCS-iADL. The scale ranges from 0 to 146, where lower scores indicate worse performance. LS Mean value was controlled for baseline value, baseline age, pooled investigator, treatment and visit., Baseline, Week 80|Percentage of Participants of Cognitive and Functional Responders, Assess the proportion of participants who reach certain levels of cognitive and functional decline. Decline in cognition was defined as worsening from baseline by at least 6 or 9 points on the ADAS Cog14. If there is a cognitive decline of a specified cut-off or more at any time then the participant is considered a nonresponder. Functional nonresponders are participants who have not had any of the following at any time point: Clinically evident decline in ability to perform one or more basic ADL present at baseline; A clinically evident decline in ability to perform 20% or more of the instrumental ADL present at baseline; An increase in global CDR score of 1 point or more compared with baseline. A decline from no impairment to mild impairment (bADL, iADL is not considered clinically significant, but other declines of 1 or more points and any participant discontinuation within the first 6 months will be considered a non-responder., Baseline through Week 80|Change From Baseline in Plasma Amyloid-Beta (Aβ) Species, Concentration of amino acid peptide known as Aβ 1-42 in plasma.
