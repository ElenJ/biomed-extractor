      "Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and is the treatment of choice to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the effect of levodopa on cardiovascular autonomic function in PD is poorly understood. Orthostatic hypotension has been documented as a potential side effect of levodopa. As a result, clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe levodopa in patients with PD with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD+OH), which leads to suboptimal management of motor symptoms. On the other hand, other studies failed to show any clear relationship between levodopa and orthostatic hypotension in patients with PD. Important limitations of prior studies include the lack of detailed investigation of baroreflex cardiovagal and sympathetic noradrenergic functions and the fact that the same patients were not tested on and off levodopa.\n\nThe investigators propose to investigate the effects of levodopa on cardiovascular autonomic function in patients with PD+OH and PD without neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD-OH) by performing standardized autonomic testing in the same patients on and off levodopa."

      "The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms, and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery, including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and post-training. During the PERSEVERE intervention, the investigators will determine the change in mentees' caregiver mastery, LBD knowledge, and loneliness."

      "Activities of daily living (ADL) frequently involve the simultaneous performance of two or more tasks, such as crossing the street while holding a conversation, commonly referred to as dual tasking. The simultaneous performance of a motor and a cognitive task increases postural instability, gait dysfunction, and may increase fall rates in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing a digital therapeutic, Dual-task Augmented Reality Treatment (DART) protocol, for the treatment of postural instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) in individuals with PD. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted at the Main Campus of the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH). A total of 50 individuals with Parkinson's disease will be randomized into 1) a traditional multi-modal training group, or 2) multi-modal training administered via an augmented reality headset. Multi-modal therapy is where the participant practices performing two things at once (i.e. marching while answering math questions). Augmented reality is a type of head-worn technology that allows the individual to see the real world and places holograms in the space. Both groups will exercise 2x/week for a total of 8 weeks. Assessments involving walking, balancing, and turning will be completed to assess the efficacy of the treatment."

      "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects approximately 1 million people in the United States with total annual costs approaching 11 billion dollars. The most common symptoms of PD are tremor, stiffness, slowness, and trouble with balance/walking, which lead to severe impairments in performing activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective add-ons to current therapeutic treatment approaches would have many benefits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can affect brain activity and can help make long-term brain changes to improve functions like walking and balance. While a few initial research studies and review articles involving tDCS have concluded that tDCS may improve PD walking and balance, many results are not meaningful in real life and several crucial issues still prevent tDCS from being a useful add-on intervention in PD. These include the selection of stimulation sites (brain regions stimulated) and tDCS electrode placement. Most studies have targeted the motor cortex (brain region that controls intentional movement), but there is evidence that the cerebellum - which helps control gait and balance, is connected to several other brain areas, and is easily stimulated with tDCS - may be a likely location to further optimize walking and balance in PD. There is also evidence that certain electrodes placements may be better than others. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of cerebellar tDCS stimulation using two different placement strategies on walking and balance in PD.\n\nAdditionally, although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities (for example, 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently used in most tDCS research are less than 2 mA, which is sufficient to produce measurable improvements; but, these improvements may be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate stimulation approaches were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities (for example, up to 4 mA) have been performed in different people and were found to have no additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established, studies exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e., 2 mA) and higher (i.e., 4 mA) intensities are necessary to determine if increasing the intensity increases the effectiveness of the desired outcome.\n\nProspective participants will include 10 people with mild-moderate PD that will be recruited to complete five randomly-ordered stimulation sessions, separated by at least 5 days each. Each session will involve one visit to the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and will last for approximately one hour. Data collection is expected to take 4-6 months. Each session will include walking and balance testing performed while wearing the tDCS device. Total tDCS stimulation time for each session will be 25 minutes."

Balance exercises such as tai chi and yoga, along with resistance training, can improve or maintain physical function in older adults and enhance muscle strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is critical for maintaining and improving cardiovascular and functional health. Non-contact boxing has recently seen a surge in popularity among individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with components of both aerobic and balance exercise. While participants anecdotally note improvements in stress and physical function, this has only been minimally studied. Therefore, we conducted a 10-week long pilot study of a structured karate exercise program. Among 15 participants, our pilot data highlights improvements in quality of life and high enthusiasm for the karate classes. Based on these promising results from the pilot, we are recruiting a larger, randomized group for the second phase of the karate intervention. The aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree a community-based karate class tailored for individuals with early- to middle-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) 1) is feasible; 2) improves objective outcomes such as mobility and balance; 3) improves patient-reported outcomes compared with individuals given a standard exercise prescription for PD."

Nabilone acts as a partial agonist on both Cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and Cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor in humans and therefore mimics the effect of THC but with more predictable side effects and less euphoria.\n\nPart 1 is an open-label dose adjustment phase of the study. In eligible patients, a screening period is followed by an open-label nabilone dose optimization phase and a stable phase for at least 1 week. Treatment responders will be included in Part 2 of the study (randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-grouped).\n\nPart 2 is the placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group randomized withdrawal phase of the study."

Mobility and cognitive limitations are a common problem in PD and are associated with significant disability, increased fall risk, reduced quality of life, and increased caregiver burden. While less is known about its benefit on cognition, physical therapy has proven to be an effective treatment to mitigate mobility limitations, though the response to rehabilitation interventions is highly variable.

Balance exercises such as tai chi and yoga, along with resistance training, can improve or maintain physical function in older adults and enhance muscle strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is critical for maintaining and improving cardiovascular and functional health. Noncontact boxing has recently seen a surge in popularity among individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with components of both aerobic and balance exercise. While participants anecdotally note improvements in stress and physical function, this has only been minimally studied. However, drawing on this experience and the combined aerobic, balance, and mindfulness practices that comprise karate, we hypothesize that participation in structured karate programs may offer similar or greater benefits.

      "P2B001 is an investigational drug that comprised of low doses of two drugs, pramipexole and rasagiline, which are both approved drugs and routinely used in standard therapy for Parkinson's disease. The two drugs work in two different mechanisms that help each other, so there is a reason to believe that their combined activity will be better than each individual drug, and that lower doses can be used without losing the therapeutic effect. Thus, the development of P2B001 is intended to provide a combination of low doses of these two drugs, in an improved formulation, that is hoped to be more effective in controlling Parkinson's disease symptoms and with less side effects than each of the drugs taken alone or the current available commercial drugs taken together. In a previously completed clinical trial a significant improvement in Parkinson's disease symptoms was seen in patients treated with P2B001 compared to patients that were treated with placebo.\n\nIn this phase 3 study , the safety and efficacy of P2B001 will be assessed by comparing P2B001 to its individual components pramipexole and rasagiline. This will be done by monitoring the motor and non-motor symptoms, evaluating responses participants provide on questionnaires relating to Parkinson's disease and quality of life that will be completed on every visit. In addition, this study will also compare P2B001 to a marketed drug of pramipexole ER.

The investigators hope to find some predictable and clinically meaningful attenuation of tremor with targeted use of onabotulinum toxin on muscles involved in creating the tremor.\n\nParticipants: 16 subjects who meet United Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria for Parkinson's disease with medically refractory rest tremor of at least 3 cm amplitude.\n\nProcedures (methods): Subjects will be blinded to receive either sham saline injection versus onabotulinum toxin injections directed to muscle groups felt to be clinically involved in causing the oscillatory movement of the tremor. Assessment of tremor severity and functional improvement from baseline after injection will occur within group (i.e. each subject will serve as their own control).\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1\\. (A) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly attenuates the amplitude of medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb in Parkinson's patients as compared to sham injections; as measured by reduction in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) tremor subscore.\n\n1\\.

      "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that results in characteristic gait dysfunction. Gait problems include decreased velocity, decreased stride length, difficulty with initiation of gait, postural stability problems and alteration in joint kinematics.1 In this typically older patient population, these gait deviations affect their participation in household and community activities. The standard of care is currently focused on therapeutic exercise and cueing of various types (visual, auditory, verbal). Current interventions have not been demonstrated to markedly improve gait kinematics, so there is a need to identify interventions that could improve gait performance in this population. Lower extremity bracing is a common and well-established intervention for gait dysfunction with other populations, including stroke and brain injury. The braces allow for improved stability, sensory feedback, and consistent tactile cues to allow patients to have the best gait mechanics with each step. It is reasonable to hypothesize that appropriate bracing may have the potential to improve gait function and kinematics in PD since these patient often have gastroc-soleus weakness. Data from our early pilot studies indicates that bracing individuals with PD can positively impact their mobility. This includes improvements in velocity, step length, and dynamic balance. Additional data supported an upward trend in quality of life."

The concomitant psychiatric symptoms, especially depression, are often observed and have also great impact on patients' quality of life. The treatment of depressive symptoms in PD with antidepressants as the majority remains variable and inefficient, which complicates the disease prognosis. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain modulation technique and has been demonstrated to improve psychiatric diseases such as major depression. In this study the investigators will assess the combined effects of tDCS on sertraline for the treatment of depression in PD. Ten sessions of tDCS in two weeks will be applied and the follow-up evaluation will continue bi-weekly for one month after completing all sessions. The efficacy of tDCS vs sertraline will be compared and evaluated with behavioral and cognitive outcome. In addition, the investigators will evaluate if the baseline dopaminergic activity in brain could predict the treatment outcome by using SPECT imaging. The investigators aim to establish the therapeutic parameters and safety criteria of tDCS as an add-on or alternative therapy, and further enhance the overall clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression in PD."

PD affected between 4.1 and 4.6 million people worldwide in 2005, and it is projected that up to 9.3 million people will be affected by 2030. Although current pharmacological therapies provide beneficial effects on motor symptoms of the disease (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia), intolerable disability eventually develops in most patients. A disease-modifying therapy that slows disease progression is a major unmet medical need in PD. Numerous agents have neuroprotective effects in pre-clinical laboratory models, but none have been shown to have indisputable disease-modifying effects in clinical trials for patients with PD.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to investigate how the brain and motor behavior changes in PD over time in response to rasagiline which is a monoamine oxidase-B(MAO-B) inhibitor. The drug rasagiline will be tested in this study as the MAO-B inhibitor. Rasagiline has been prescribed for many years to treat symptomatic Parkinson's disease. It is FDA approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease but has not been shown to slow disease progression.

Current medicines for PD only improve symptoms, treatments that slow disease progression are needed, and earlier diagnosis of PD may be the key to their development. PD symptoms can be mimicked by medicines (most commonly antipsychotic drugs that block dopamine), and some of these patients actually have underlying \"prodromal\" PD that was \"unmasked\" years before it would have caused symptoms. This problem is increasing as these medicines are now used for common conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. The investigators will identify prodromal PD in patients with drug-induced symptoms using brain scans. These patients will be enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of aerobic exercise which slows progression in animal models of PD and has other health benefits. The investigators will measure the effect of exercise on symptoms, disease progression (using brain scans) and markers of PD risk (using blood tests). These studies will improve early PD diagnosis and potentially identify a way to slow progression of PD."

The Real-PD study aim to evaluate the feasibility and compliance of usage of wearable sensors in PD patients in real life. Moreover, an explorative analysis concerning activity level, medication intake and mood will be done.\n\nMethods: Overall, 1000 PD patients and 250 physiotherapist will be enrolled in this observational study. Dutch PD patients will be recruited across the country and an assessment will be performed using a short version of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) protocol. Moreover, participants will wear a set of medical devices (Pebble Smartwatch, fall detector) and they will use a smartphone with The Fox Insight App (Android app), 24/7, during 13 weeks. Primary measures of interest are: 1) physical activity, falls and tremor, measured by the axial accelerometers embedded in the Pebble watch and fall detector; and 2) medication intake and mood reports measured by patients' self-report in the Android app. To measure motor impact, an assessment will be performed by physiotherapists who are all certified to perform the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).\n\nDiscussion: Management of PD patients is complex and appears to be a challenging task for health care professionals. The main reason is the lack of knowledge in the disease pattern. This issue could be solved by a long term follow-up of patients' during their everyday life, and wearable medical devices can act as a way to collect data about every day life activities.

      "Gait and balance disturbances are one of the most incapacitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Boonstra et al. 2008). They can cause falls and are therefore associated with the negative spiral of (near) falls, fear of falling, fractures, reduced mobility and social isolation; hence, having a profound negative impact on quality of life (Lin et al. 2012). Originally, symptoms of PD were ascribed to dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia dysfunction (Wu et al. 2013). However, in the last decades it has become clear that other brain structures are also involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Snijders et al. 2011; Stefani et al. 2007). An intriguing, emerging insight is that the cerebellum may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Wu et al. 2013). That is, the cerebellum is hyperactive in PD patients during different motor tasks (Yu et al. 2007; Hanakawa et al. 1999; del Olmo et al. 2006). However, whether cerebellar hyperactivity is pathological or compensatory and how it affects gait and balance in PD patients remain open questions. Here, the investigators aim to elucidate the role of the hyperactive cerebellum in gait dysfunction in PD patients by modulating cerebellar excitability with state-of-the-art non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and investigate the effects on gait."
