    "\n",
    "### **1. Population**\n",
    "- **Precision/Recall/F1:**  \n",
    "  - All three models perform well, with F1 scores between 0.82–0.91.\n",
    "  - **bio-mobilebert** has the highest F1 (0.91), suggesting slightly better capture of eligible populations from trial texts.\n",
    "  - All three achieve high recall (0.86–0.96) and acceptable precision (0.82–0.91).\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "  Models are robust at extracting population, with *bio-mobilebert* having an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Intervention**\n",
    "- **Precision/Recall/F1:**  \n",
    "  - F1 hovers in the 0.57–0.62 range: good recall (~0.83–0.87), but lower precision (0.54–0.61).\n",
    "  - **dmis-lab_biobert-v1.1** is strongest on precision (0.61) and has the highest F1 (0.62), though only marginally better than the others.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "  All models successfully recall interventions, but still display a tendency to overcall, resulting in modest precision. *dmis-lab_biobert* may be best balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Comparator**  \n",
    "- **Precision/Recall/F1:**  All identical (0.95). **Remember**: this isn't a test of the models, but of the comparator extraction function from cleaned intervention metadata.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Do not use this column to differentiate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Outcome**\n",
    "- **Precision/Recall/F1:**  \n",
    "  - All models nearly identical and very strong (precision ~0.90, recall ~0.97, F1 ~0.93).\n",

    "- **For most purposes:** Any of these models will deliver good outcome extraction, high-quality population extraction, and moderately reliable intervention extraction, though users should expect some false positives in interventions.\n",
    "- **If population extraction is mission critical:** *nlpie_bio-mobilebert* edges out the others.\n",
    "- **If a small advantage in intervention precision/F1 matters:** *dmis-lab_biobert-v1.1* is preferred.\n",
