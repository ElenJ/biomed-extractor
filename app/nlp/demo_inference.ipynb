         "The overall goal of this double-blind Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological mechanisms of action of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). IVIg contains antibodies against the amyloid beta protein that is the central component of the AD senile plaque. It is hypothesized that IVIg treatment will reduce the levels of beta amyloid in the brain and improve cognitive abilities relative to placebo. A total of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD capable of giving informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive either IVIg (16 patients)or saline placebo (8 patients) for six months. This study includes comparison of four dosing regimens of IVIg. Cognitive, behavioral and functional measures will be collected at baseline, three months and six months of treatment. Plasma samples will be collected before and after infusions. Subjects will undergo a lumbar puncture before and after the six months of treatment for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses. In addition, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Following the initial 6 month placebo-controlled period, all participants have the opportunity to receive IVIg for an additional 12 month period in an extension study.",
         "Abnormal processing of the beta-amyloid protein is thought to be an early and causative event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeting beta amyloid (Aβ) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to arrest and even reverse elements of AD brain pathology. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a medication obtained from the pooled plasma of healthy human blood donors that contains natural anti-amyloid antibodies and exhibits potent central nervous system anti-inflammatory properties. IVIg has been FDA-approved and used for more than 25 years in patients with a variety of immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases and has an established safety record, but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of AD.\n\nA total of 24 patients, males and females 50 years of age and older, with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be enrolled in this research study. To be eligible, patients must meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. After written informed consent is obtained, subjects will go through a screening process to determine if he or she meets the inclusion criteria. Screening procedures include medical history, blood and urine tests, neurologic exam, chest x-ray and MRI. Women who want to take part in this study must either be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or agree to avoid becoming pregnant during the entire period of their participation in this study.\n\nTo be eligible for this research study, patients must be taking a stable dose of an approved AD medication for at least 3 months prior to entering this study or be unable to take these medications. The design of this protocol is that of an add-on study and we will recommend patients continue to take any FDA-approved AD medications they are taking at study entry.\n\nSubjects' participation in the study will last approximately 19 months, including screening and baseline procedures, treatment with study drug and a follow-up visit 1 ½ months after finishing treatment, plus a visit for blood tests 6 months after the last infusion in the study. This research study requires that the patient have another person, (such as a spouse, child, other relative, close friend, aide or other professional caregiver), who will accompany the patient to each clinic visit.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to a treatment group for 6 months of infusions of IVIg or placebo. The treatment groups compare different doses and frequencies of treatment. Patients will have a 33% chance of receiving placebo.\n\nBlood will be obtained from subjects every two weeks and examined in our research laboratories to obtain more information about IVIg's biological effects. Cerebrospinal fluid will be obtained by lumbar puncture twice over the course of the study for the same purpose. Patients will be asked to allow a portion of a blood sample to be used for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing and banked for genetic research testing related to AD and aging, but do not have to participate in the testing or allow their blood sample to be stored in order to take part in the study.\n\nCognitive testing will be carried out at baseline and every three months over a period of 18 months. Results of cognitive testing will constitute the primary endpoint of this study. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Safety laboratories and assessments will be carried out at regular intervals. Subjects will not be responsible for any research study-related costs but will be responsible for the costs of evaluations required to establish diagnosis.",

         "The overall goal of this double-blind Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological mechanisms of action of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). IVIg contains antibodies against the amyloid beta protein that is the central component of the AD senile plaque. It is hypothesized that IVIg treatment will reduce the levels of beta amyloid in the brain and improve cognitive abilities relative to placebo. A total of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD capable of giving informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive either IVIg (16 patients)or saline placebo (8 patients) for six months. This study includes comparison of four dosing regimens of IVIg. Cognitive, behavioral and functional measures will be collected at baseline, three months and six months of treatment. Plasma samples will be collected before and after infusions. Subjects will undergo a lumbar puncture before and after the six months of treatment for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses. In addition, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Following the initial 6 month placebo-controlled period, all participants have the opportunity to receive IVIg for an additional 12 month period in an extension study.",
         "Abnormal processing of the beta-amyloid protein is thought to be an early and causative event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeting beta amyloid (Aβ) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to arrest and even reverse elements of AD brain pathology. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a medication obtained from the pooled plasma of healthy human blood donors that contains natural anti-amyloid antibodies and exhibits potent central nervous system anti-inflammatory properties. IVIg has been FDA-approved and used for more than 25 years in patients with a variety of immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases and has an established safety record, but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of AD.\n\nA total of 24 patients, males and females 50 years of age and older, with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be enrolled in this research study. To be eligible, patients must meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. After written informed consent is obtained, subjects will go through a screening process to determine if he or she meets the inclusion criteria. Screening procedures include medical history, blood and urine tests, neurologic exam, chest x-ray and MRI. Women who want to take part in this study must either be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or agree to avoid becoming pregnant during the entire period of their participation in this study.\n\nTo be eligible for this research study, patients must be taking a stable dose of an approved AD medication for at least 3 months prior to entering this study or be unable to take these medications. The design of this protocol is that of an add-on study and we will recommend patients continue to take any FDA-approved AD medications they are taking at study entry.\n\nSubjects' participation in the study will last approximately 19 months, including screening and baseline procedures, treatment with study drug and a follow-up visit 1 ½ months after finishing treatment, plus a visit for blood tests 6 months after the last infusion in the study. This research study requires that the patient have another person, (such as a spouse, child, other relative, close friend, aide or other professional caregiver), who will accompany the patient to each clinic visit.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to a treatment group for 6 months of infusions of IVIg or placebo. The treatment groups compare different doses and frequencies of treatment. Patients will have a 33% chance of receiving placebo.\n\nBlood will be obtained from subjects every two weeks and examined in our research laboratories to obtain more information about IVIg's biological effects. Cerebrospinal fluid will be obtained by lumbar puncture twice over the course of the study for the same purpose. Patients will be asked to allow a portion of a blood sample to be used for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing and banked for genetic research testing related to AD and aging, but do not have to participate in the testing or allow their blood sample to be stored in order to take part in the study.\n\nCognitive testing will be carried out at baseline and every three months over a period of 18 months. Results of cognitive testing will constitute the primary endpoint of this study. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Safety laboratories and assessments will be carried out at regular intervals.

    "**Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Population Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model extracts population information with relatively low precision but high recall, meaning it often identifies relevant population terms but also includes many incorrect or extractions. The F1 score suggests moderate overall performance for this element. Population entities were identified using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline applied primarily to the clinical trial’s inclusion criteria. Entities were filtered to keep those containing demographic or diagnostic keywords (like “patients,” “adults,” “participants”), or were sufficiently long. Further deduplication ensured removal of duplicates and irrelevant short/generic terms.\n",
    "Recall is high (0.72): The NER pipeline detects most relevant population mentions in the inclusion text, so few true population groups are missed.\n",
    "Precision is low (0.38): Many extracted entities are not true population descriptors—they might include overly broad terms, generic statements, or irrelevant/ambiguous phrases that “sneak through” the filters. This indicates an over-inclusive extraction.\n",
    "F1 is moderate (0.48): The post-processing and rules applied after NER allow for capturing many relevant terms, but noise remains. Improving precision may require more refined patterns, stricter filtering, or model fine-tuning to better distinguish actual population descriptors from unrelated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Intervention Extraction:**\n",
    "The intervention extraction shows strong performance across all metrics, achieving high precision and recall. This indicates that the model can reliably identify both the correct and most relevant interventions described in the studies. Intervention entities were extracted by applying NER to the combined “briefSummary” and “detailedDescription” fields. Interventions were subsequently normalized (lowercasing, removing punctuation, deduplicating via substring/fuzzy matching, and filtering out generic words and known comparators through rules).\n",
    "Precision and recall are both high: The extraction and cleaning pipeline reliably identifies intervention terms, correctly excluding generic and comparator-related items. Most interventions described in the studies are captured, with few false positives.\n",
    "F1 is high (0.76): The NER, normalization, and deduplication steps are very effective for intervention mentions, which often follow standard phrasing in clinical trial descriptions. This means your model/pipeline is well-tuned for identifying medical treatments, drugs, or procedures described as interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Comparator Extraction:**\n",
    "The comparator extraction is moderately successful, but there is room for improvement in both precision and recall. \n",
    "The reported scores for comparator do not reflect the NER model’s semantic understanding but rather the performance of a rule-based string search for typical comparator words. High or low scores in this element reflect the adequacy of the keyword list and matching strategy, not deep contextual comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Outcome Extraction:**\n",
    "Outcome extraction shows the lowest scores, particularly in recall, meaning the model frequently misses important outcome-related information. Precision is also low, suggesting difficulty in correctly identifying outcome terms.\n",
    "Outcome entities were extracted (via NER) primarily from the main trial text (“briefSummary” + “detailedDescription”) and further cleaned by removing irrelevant punctuation and deduplicating. No further deep semantic filtering was applied. Low recall indicates that many relevant outcomes described in the study are missed by the extraction pipeline. This often happens because outcome phrases are highly variable, domain-specific, and less standardized than interventions or population descriptions.\n",
    "Precision is also low: Among the outcomes that are extracted, a substantial proportion do not match the gold standard (manual annotation)—underscoring challenges in both identification and correct labeling.\n",
    "F1 is poor: Current rules and model performance for outcome extraction are not sufficient; a wide range of true outcome statements remain undetected. This typically happens because outcomes are often complex, multi-part, or intricately worded, and may need custom NER or more advanced semantic processing.\n",
    "Recommendation: Improving outcome extraction may require richer domain-specific training for the NER model, targeted rules for outcome phrasing, or even leveraging structured data (if present) from trial registries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Summary (ROUGE Scores):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieves high performance in extractive summarization, with strong ROUGE scores for unigram, bigram, and longest subsequence matches. The high recall values show the generated summaries cover most of the key content (which has been revealed in the brief Summary of the clinicaltrials.gov data), and the precision indicates the generation is relevant and concise. Keep in mind that the implemented summarization is extractive and uses TextRank on “briefSummary + description”. Its evaluated ROUGE scores (vs. the single “briefSummary” field) assess overlap with the trial’s own concise summary. A very high ROUGE might reflect redundancy—i.e., TextRank often picks similar or even identical sentences to those in briefSummary because it draws content directly from the same text pool. These metrics should not be interpreted as evidence of abstractive or generative summarization quality; rather, they indicate the ability of TextRank to extract content that matches what was originally selected as a summary by the trial authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model performs best on intervention extraction and summary generation, with high precision and recall in those areas. Population and comparator extraction are moderate, while outcome extraction requires significant improvement. The summary quality is excellent according to ROUGE metrics, meaning that end-users will likely receive concise and representative study summaries. Further development should focus on improving outcome extraction accuracy and refining population/comparator detection."
