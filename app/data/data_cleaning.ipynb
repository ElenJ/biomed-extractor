         "The overall goal of this double-blind Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological mechanisms of action of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). IVIg contains antibodies against the amyloid beta protein that is the central component of the AD senile plaque. It is hypothesized that IVIg treatment will reduce the levels of beta amyloid in the brain and improve cognitive abilities relative to placebo. A total of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD capable of giving informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive either IVIg (16 patients)or saline placebo (8 patients) for six months. This study includes comparison of four dosing regimens of IVIg. Cognitive, behavioral and functional measures will be collected at baseline, three months and six months of treatment. Plasma samples will be collected before and after infusions. Subjects will undergo a lumbar puncture before and after the six months of treatment for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses. In addition, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Following the initial 6 month placebo-controlled period, all participants have the opportunity to receive IVIg for an additional 12 month period in an extension study.",
         "Abnormal processing of the beta-amyloid protein is thought to be an early and causative event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeting beta amyloid (Aβ) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to arrest and even reverse elements of AD brain pathology. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a medication obtained from the pooled plasma of healthy human blood donors that contains natural anti-amyloid antibodies and exhibits potent central nervous system anti-inflammatory properties. IVIg has been FDA-approved and used for more than 25 years in patients with a variety of immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases and has an established safety record, but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of AD.\n\nA total of 24 patients, males and females 50 years of age and older, with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be enrolled in this research study. To be eligible, patients must meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. After written informed consent is obtained, subjects will go through a screening process to determine if he or she meets the inclusion criteria. Screening procedures include medical history, blood and urine tests, neurologic exam, chest x-ray and MRI. Women who want to take part in this study must either be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or agree to avoid becoming pregnant during the entire period of their participation in this study.\n\nTo be eligible for this research study, patients must be taking a stable dose of an approved AD medication for at least 3 months prior to entering this study or be unable to take these medications. The design of this protocol is that of an add-on study and we will recommend patients continue to take any FDA-approved AD medications they are taking at study entry.\n\nSubjects' participation in the study will last approximately 19 months, including screening and baseline procedures, treatment with study drug and a follow-up visit 1 ½ months after finishing treatment, plus a visit for blood tests 6 months after the last infusion in the study. This research study requires that the patient have another person, (such as a spouse, child, other relative, close friend, aide or other professional caregiver), who will accompany the patient to each clinic visit.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to a treatment group for 6 months of infusions of IVIg or placebo. The treatment groups compare different doses and frequencies of treatment. Patients will have a 33% chance of receiving placebo.\n\nBlood will be obtained from subjects every two weeks and examined in our research laboratories to obtain more information about IVIg's biological effects. Cerebrospinal fluid will be obtained by lumbar puncture twice over the course of the study for the same purpose. Patients will be asked to allow a portion of a blood sample to be used for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing and banked for genetic research testing related to AD and aging, but do not have to participate in the testing or allow their blood sample to be stored in order to take part in the study.\n\nCognitive testing will be carried out at baseline and every three months over a period of 18 months. Results of cognitive testing will constitute the primary endpoint of this study. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Safety laboratories and assessments will be carried out at regular intervals. Subjects will not be responsible for any research study-related costs but will be responsible for the costs of evaluations required to establish diagnosis.",

         "The overall goal of this double-blind Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological mechanisms of action of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of mild to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). IVIg contains antibodies against the amyloid beta protein that is the central component of the AD senile plaque. It is hypothesized that IVIg treatment will reduce the levels of beta amyloid in the brain and improve cognitive abilities relative to placebo. A total of 24 patients with mild to moderate AD capable of giving informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive either IVIg (16 patients)or saline placebo (8 patients) for six months. This study includes comparison of four dosing regimens of IVIg. Cognitive, behavioral and functional measures will be collected at baseline, three months and six months of treatment. Plasma samples will be collected before and after infusions. Subjects will undergo a lumbar puncture before and after the six months of treatment for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses. In addition, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study. Following the initial 6 month placebo-controlled period, all participants have the opportunity to receive IVIg for an additional 12 month period in an extension study.",
         "Abnormal processing of the beta-amyloid protein is thought to be an early and causative event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeting beta amyloid (Aβ) has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to arrest and even reverse elements of AD brain pathology. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a medication obtained from the pooled plasma of healthy human blood donors that contains natural anti-amyloid antibodies and exhibits potent central nervous system anti-inflammatory properties. IVIg has been FDA-approved and used for more than 25 years in patients with a variety of immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases and has an established safety record, but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of AD.\n\nA total of 24 patients, males and females 50 years of age and older, with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be enrolled in this research study. To be eligible, patients must meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. After written informed consent is obtained, subjects will go through a screening process to determine if he or she meets the inclusion criteria. Screening procedures include medical history, blood and urine tests, neurologic exam, chest x-ray and MRI. Women who want to take part in this study must either be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or agree to avoid becoming pregnant during the entire period of their participation in this study.\n\nTo be eligible for this research study, patients must be taking a stable dose of an approved AD medication for at least 3 months prior to entering this study or be unable to take these medications. The design of this protocol is that of an add-on study and we will recommend patients continue to take any FDA-approved AD medications they are taking at study entry.\n\nSubjects' participation in the study will last approximately 19 months, including screening and baseline procedures, treatment with study drug and a follow-up visit 1 ½ months after finishing treatment, plus a visit for blood tests 6 months after the last infusion in the study. This research study requires that the patient have another person, (such as a spouse, child, other relative, close friend, aide or other professional caregiver), who will accompany the patient to each clinic visit.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to a treatment group for 6 months of infusions of IVIg or placebo. The treatment groups compare different doses and frequencies of treatment. Patients will have a 33% chance of receiving placebo.\n\nBlood will be obtained from subjects every two weeks and examined in our research laboratories to obtain more information about IVIg's biological effects. Cerebrospinal fluid will be obtained by lumbar puncture twice over the course of the study for the same purpose. Patients will be asked to allow a portion of a blood sample to be used for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing and banked for genetic research testing related to AD and aging, but do not have to participate in the testing or allow their blood sample to be stored in order to take part in the study.\n\nCognitive testing will be carried out at baseline and every three months over a period of 18 months. Results of cognitive testing will constitute the primary endpoint of this study. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging substudies will be performed at two time points during the study.

Using in-scanner tasks shown to reliably elicit brain activity in cortical regions important to memory and attention, this treatment trial will examine both resting and task-related BOLD signal characteristics in a well-characterized sample of 36 mild AD patients after periods of low dose and high dose AD dementia treatment with either galantamine hydrobromide (AChEI + nicotinic receptor modulation) or donepezil hydrochloride (AChEI only).

Study drug will first be dispensed at the baseline visit. The treatment phase is composed of a titration period (the study drug will be introduced gradually) and a maintenance period and includes 9 visits (3 of which are conducted by telephone). The titration period is 12 weeks long, and visits occur about every 28 days. In the first 4 weeks of the titration period, subjects will receive either 8 mg galantamine or matching placebo, and this dose will be increased to 16 mg galantamine or placebo in the second 4 weeks. The dose will then be increased to 24 mg galantamine or placebo for the final 4 weeks of the titration period if the investigator believes the subject will benefit from and will safely tolerate 24 mg/day. If not, the subject may continue to receive 16 mg galantamine or placebo through the end of the titration period. After the titration period, subjects will enter the maintenance period and continue to take study drug at the dosage they received at the end of the titration period. This dosage may be continued through the end of the study or may be changed once (either up from 16 to 24 mg or down from 24 to 16 mg), depending upon the benefit and the safety of such a change for the individual patient as judged by the investigator. No dosage will exceed 24 mg/day. The posttreatment phase includes an End-of-Study Visit that occurs at the end of the maintenance period. A follow-up telephone contact (interview) is conducted 1 month after the End-of-Study Visit. The effectiveness of galantamine will be evaluated using the following tools: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); the Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD); and the Assessment of Patient Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden (APAS CarB). Safety evaluations for the study include the monitoring of vital status and institutionalization status, adverse events, vital signs, weight, physical and neurologic examinations. A Data Safety Monitoring Board, external to the company, has been commissioned for this study to monitor the progress of the study and to ensure that the safety of patients is not compromised. The effectiveness hypothesis of this study is that galantamine, 16 to 24 mg per day, is superior to placebo in reducing cognitive decline from baseline (start of study drug) as measured by the MMSE over the course of 2 years. The safety hypothesis is that the mortality rate in the galantamine 16 to 24 mg per day treatment group will be the same as that in the placebo group over the course of 2 years.",

         "The overarching goal of this proposal is to enhance the existing information technology infrastructure in Central Indiana to improve the nation's capacity to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER). Consistent with the instructions in RFA-HS-10-005, the investigators propose to apply these new capacities to a novel CER project evaluating treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a first quartile CER priority. This proposal represents collaboration between the Medical Informatics Program at the Regenstrief Institute, Inc (a world leader in health information technology) and two Indiana University research programs: the Center for Aging Research and the Division of Clinical Pharmacology. These programs have an established track record in research relevant to under-served populations. Thus, this proposal combines considerable investigator, environment, and research strengths to continue to build a novel CER infrastructure in support of the nation's evidentiary CER priorities.\n\nThroughout this proposal, the investigators use the AHRQ definition of CER: the conduct and synthesis of research comparing the benefits and harms of different interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor health conditions in real world settings.\" The investigators also refer to a clinical trial of medication treatment for behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease as the specific CER proposed to demonstrate the potential of our new infrastructure. However, the investigators stress that the enhancements proposed to existing infrastructure would support a broad portfolio of CER across an array of priority conditions. The investigators are also proposing enhancements in our privacy and confidentiality technology that would allow researchers from across the country to access de-identified data in support of CER. In summary, the investigators are proposing to add new CER knowledge on Alzheimer' disease and thereby field test new information technology capacities important to a wide range of CER projects while also increasing our capacity to provide data and opportunities for nationwide CER.\n\nThe derivation of meaningful and actionable evidence from CER ultimately depends on capturing relevant, comprehensive and accurate data about treatment decisions, patients' clinical status, their care processes and environment, and the health outcomes they experience and value. Such data must be tracked longitudinally in order to determine temporal relationships, cause-effect paradigms, and the efficacy of specific clinical interventions in the context of other conditions, interventions, and goals of care. At Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute, the investigators have four decades of experience and a well-documented, world-class clinical informatics and research infrastructure for capturing, storing, querying and analyzing treatment patterns and patients' clinical outcomes.\n\nThe maturation of this health information technology is now embodied within the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a fully-operational regional health information exchange. The investigators are well positioned to expand and leverage this infrastructure in support of local and national multi-site clinical trials in comparative effectiveness. The specific aims of this proposal are to:\n\n1.0 PROSPECT STUDY: Enhance our existing information technology infrastructure to:\n\n1. provide de-identified access to the INPC database for CER work\n2. capture, store, and track a broader array of health care outcomes important to patients and their caregivers (e.g. behavioral symptoms due to dementia);\n3. support providers' and caregivers' and researchers' increasing need to work in teams by providing new tools for communication and co-management (e.g. collaborative care and research)\n\n2.0 COMET-AD STUDY: Conduct comparative effectiveness clinical trial of medication treatment for behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in a group of real-world memory care clinics with enhanced access to the Indiana Network for Patient Care.",

         "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly patients. By its prevalence and its medical and social consequences, AD represents a dual challenge to public health and society. The elderly want to stay in their homes even when their lives are altered by a chronic progressive disease. Their caregivers claim in turn a support at home. But this desire is questioned because of the characteristics of the disease, e.g. the altered relational function by the cognitive impairment and the behavioural disorders associated.\n\nOutpatients non-drug therapies represent a potential support that adapts to patient with an AD or mixed dementia, especially in their milder forms.\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a weekly rehabilitation's intervention at home and its acceptability by both the patient and the caregiver.\n\nThe study of its efficiency in terms of autonomy will be the next step.",

All home visits and assessments of the patient and his caregiver will be made by the rehabilitation's therapist himself.\n\nTwelve weekly interventions at home are planed. The first five are needed to define a realistic and achievable goal of treatment which is accepted by the dyad and the therapist. The following seven interventions will achieve this goal by rehabilitation's intervention (e.g. occupational therapy, psychomotor approach).\n\nFour filmed sessions for dyad's assessment are planned (at inclusion, at weeks 5 and 12 after inclusion and 3 months after the last intervention).",

         "Cerebral functioning changes with age in order to respond to the impacts of different external and internal factors on the brain, and more generally on the human body. Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that during life the brain develops specific neural networks to handle with cognitive activities. When these networks are impaired due to factors that damage brain structure and/or brain functioning, the brain adapts and elaborates new networks to cope with this situation. A cognitive reserve built throughout life and an appropriated care such as for example cognitive training, are in the centre of this model because they are involved in building these networks. In general, studies exploring cognitive training in normal aging and in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease have shown some benefits of the training on cognitive functioning. It has been shown not only that the cognitive training improves older adults' cognition, but also that these effects last for a long time and positively influence older people everyday activities. In fact, the benefits from memory training were observed 5 years after the end of the training and those of reasoning and of speed of processing even after 10 years. In addition, majority of the participants declared to notice improvement of their everyday life. Concerning Alzheimer's disease, several studies have observed positive results of cognitive training although there are some controversies about its' effects. Numerous studies point out that for cognitive training being the most efficient, the intervention has to take place as early as possible, preferentially in a premorbid stage of the disease and that it is important to propose trainings that minimize the withdrawal. In this sense, the importance of using computer based training was put forward because it allows the elaboration of multiple exercises with playful aspect and more importantly it can adapt on line the difficulty of the exercises to the patient's performance. However, if it is commonly admitted that computer based training has an important role in physician's, psychologist's or speech therapist's office less is known about the efficiency of this type of training performed at distance, at the patient's place of residence. It seems probable that to propose distance training as an additional training to that performed in a practitioner's office would increase training benefits. To investigators knowledge this was not investigated in a systematic way with Alzheimer's disease patients. The more important advantages of a such additional training are: (1) reduction of patients' travelling, (2) increased flexibility of training scheduling and (3) increased frequency of training sessions per week.\n\nThus, in the present study investigators will examine in a systematic way, whether the distance training, as an additional training to this performed in practitioner's office, brings incremental short- and long-term benefits coming from cognitive training in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. Investigators second objective is to determine what would be the best frequency per week of such an additional training.",

The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment., 78 weeks|The Change From Baseline in the Disability Assessment for Demential (DAD) Total Score at Week 78, The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100.
